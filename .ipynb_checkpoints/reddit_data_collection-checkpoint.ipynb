Google [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google it, right now. Who\\u2019s reporting this? China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the markets don't seem to have a clue.\\n\\nTL;DR: Simply put, I believe the markets have not reacted to China\\u2019s most recent advancements in quantum computing. China is potentially not as far behind the USA as markets would have you believe. I provide here a commentary of recent market movements, in relation to recent quantum computing news and developments. I follow with a more technical discussion of the significance of China\\u2019s advancements, those of US corporations.\\n\\nFinancial disclaimer: While I justify my comments where possible, some of the comments I make in this post are pure speculation. I do not recommend making speculative trades, such as shorting quantum computing, or buying quantum cybersecurity. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.\\n\\nI was astounded to see the latest news dominating the headlines. How did the market not know that China was developing its own language-learning models? I\\u2019m a filthy casual, and even I knew about it. It\\u2019s been in our news at least [since July](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/20/deepseek-v2-0628-released-an-improved-open-source-version-of-deepseek-v2/), and available for use [since September last year](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news0905). It was pretty fucking good back then, too. And there\\u2019s Alibaba\\u2019s Qwenchat, Tencent\\u2019s HunYuan, among numerous others they haven\\u2019t even started talking about yet. What else have they forgotten, in this wild speculative bull run? They probably think the USA is lightyears ahead in quantum computing too. Oh, oh. They do.\\n\\nBefore you go any further, look up [Tianyan-504](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml). Look up [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11924). Google them, right now. They\\u2019re right there, massive Chinese developments both announced in December 2024. The Tianyan-504 surpasses 500 qubits, on par with IBM\\u2019s latest developments. And Zuchongzhi 3.0 demolishes Google\\u2019s earlier Sycamore by all key metrics. Why can\\u2019t we find any article produced by any reputable financial sources, that discuss the significance of these achievements? There is essentially zero market news about it. China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the market has no fucking clue.\\n\\nCheck out D-Wave stock prices, for example. Given their business model relies in part on how they contribute to research in the field, they should be negatively impacted by major research developments in competing economies.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4iggbqnq57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5089134b48021f96baf28b66e5a7dc377b7dee7\\n\\nThis suggests that while Google\\u2019s Willow breakthrough rallied quantum computing stocks and Nvidia\\u2019s CEO pushed them back down, China\\u2019s developments have had zero impact.\\n\\nHow about Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT)? It tells a similar story. Their focus is on fabrication of photonic quantum computing components \\u2013 and again, providing researchers access to quantum computing technology. It looks like Google\\u2019s Willow breakthrough rallied stocks, and Nvidia\\u2019s CEO pushed them back down. China\\u2019s developments have had zero impact.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9dnfa0s57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f77fb7a50a22340541b4c426433ff210c9a7fbe0\\n\\nHow about IBM? News about Google\\u2019s Willow pushed their price down some 3%, which makes good sense. Willow\\u2019s performace blew that of IBM\\u2019s September R2 Heron processor out of the water. Willow is a competitor, but IBM\\u2019s position in the market means they are diversified in so much more than just quantum computing. A small bearish reaction makes perfect sense. So when Tianyan-504 reportedly challenged IBM's benchmarks just three days before Willow did, why didn\\u2019t the stock price move?\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6t1ik5t57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=5377770391681d2bfe3ac54d106217216c3f7feb\\n\\nYou can look at SkyWater Technologies (SKYT), and at Global Foundries (GFS), and Rigetti (RGTI), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), TSM (TSM), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Every one of these key companies relevant to advancing quantum computing in the Western World have one thing in common. When China announces their developments, the markets appear to stay still.\\n\\nThere are three possible reasons for this that I have come up with. There may be other reasons as well that I am not aware of, in which case I encourage you to enlighten me.\\n\\nThe first possible reason is as above: The market is generally not aware. It is likely that some players in the market are aware, and this is a simple piece of information that such players will be taking advantage of \\u2013 they do not have incentive to highlight this knowledge. Furthermore, the market may be uniquely slow to react. Unlike DeepSeek, which we can physically interact with, breaking records in quantum computing research is less tangible, less sensational. Breaking news, markets are irrational.\\n\\nThe second possible reason is simple: China may be lying. I can not find any evidence to support this idea, and China\\u2019s past claims about quantum computing, such as those about [Jiuzhang](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), have been demonstrably true.\\n\\nThe third possible reason is that China\\u2019s quantum computers are not as technically advanced as they sound. Originally I wanted to follow with a full technical discussion about the recent history of Chinese Quantum computing, and the merits of Tianyan-504 and Zuchongzhi 3.0 in comparison to western quantum computing efforts. But since I am not a subject matter expert, and I do not have the time to write in full depth. But I will provide a bit more technical information, summarise and provide references to the academic research for relevant breakthrough technologies, so you can read for yourself.\\n\\nChina is fighting to lead the global race in quantum computing, and [the Chinese government has been investing tens of billions of dollars into quantum computing research](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/04/13/chinese-quantum-companies-and-national-strategy-2023/), alongside the investments of Chinese institutions and corporations.\\n\\nIn 2020 [Jiuzhang, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), was the second quantum computer in the world to achieve quantum supremacy](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), and the first photonic quantum computer to do so. Since then, the university has gone on to create further models of Jiuzhang, and develop chips with greater qubit lifetime and fidelity.\\n\\nIn April 2024, The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics developed their [Xiaohong superconducting chip](https://english.news.cn/20240425/a95b3c190a59486886f4cddc0def31cd/c.html), their most advanced to date, anticipated to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM\\u2019s Heron in key performance metrics including qubit lifetime (how long a qubit can hold its quantum state) and readout fidelity (accuracy in extracting information from qubits). I note the market did not appear to react to the Xiaohong chip either.\\n\\nOn the 13^(th) of November 2024,[ IBM announced their Quantum Heron R2](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), achieving their goal of running quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gates, demonstrating advancements in in qubit lifetime and readout fidelity.\\n\\nOn the 6^(th) of December 2024, [Tianyan-504 was announced](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml), developed by China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., and, built on the Xiaohong chips. China is now the only country to achieve quantum computational advantage through both photonics and superconducting quantum computing technologies. This quantum computer will be incorporated into their quantum computing cloud platform, and made available for researcher purposes.On the 9^(th) of December, [Google\\u2019s Willow was announced](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/). What makes Willow exceptional, is that it provides a breakthrough solution to quantum computing\\u2019s fidelity issue. It exponentially reduces the amount of error while adding more qubits. Presumably Willow can now be scaled further, and I expect to see further developments with adding more qubits now that this challenge has been solved.\\n\\nTwo weeks later, on the 16^(th) of December 2024, an entirely separate research team with the China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. [announced their Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.11924v1#S1). This superconducting quantum computer makes numerous advancements, and demonstrates quantum advantage through speed. It crushes benchmarks set by Google\\u2019s older Sycamore - \\u201cCompared to Google\\u2019s latest experiment, SYC-67 and SYC-70\\u00a0 the classical simulation cost of our 83-qubit, 32-cycle experiment is six orders of magnitude higher.\\u201d Though Zuchongzhi 3.0 does not demonstrate the error correction capability that Willow does, their creators have commented that they believe they can replicate the same techniques in a matter of months.\\n\\nQuantum computing is still twenty years away from being relevant, they say. That gives lots of time for China to catch up. And from what I can understand, China is just one breakthrough away. There are other questions, such as China\\u2019s chip manufacturing capabilities, supply chains for components, that I am unable to find good information on. The US is doing what they can politically, through trade regulation, and restricting financial investment in China\\u2019s technologies. China already has the [lead in quantum communications, and potentially in quantum sensing](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/). But China holds one massive advantage: it\\u2019s regime. In contrast to the American model, where corporations closely guard their own secrets from eachother, [China is claims they invest 15 billion of dollars into coordinated, cohesive research.](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/) And it is showing in their results.\\n\\nEach advancement that China makes in developing its quantum computing capability, ought to remind the market that there is a risk that the lead the US enjoys in quantum computing is being threatened. But look at those google search results again. Outside of technical circles, the western media simply hasn't picked it up. Look at what happened with DeepSeek. I think the markets just don't know. Investors are already anxious about their investments in quantum computing, and are starting to demand returns. Manufacturers are reluctant to scale component production, given the low demand and potential for volatility. So when the market does find out about China\\u2019s achievements in quantum computing, what's going to happen?\\n\\nLet me know what you think.\\n\\nDisclosure of positions:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qlgr3l7w57ge1.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=d480c14a5164357c4a951a0033a861631ea589f8\\n\\n\",\n          \"* Tech stocks took a beating Monday as China\\u2019s DeepSeek AI debuted a model that rivals U.S. counterparts at a fraction of the cost, sending shockwaves through the Nasdaq, which dropped over 3%.

Jerome Powell and his crew are expected to keep the key rate at 4.3%, marking a cautious pause after last year\\u2019s three consecutive reductions.\\n\\n**Why the Pause?**  \\n  \\nInflation is cooling\\u2014but not enough. Prices are hovering at 2.4%, just above the Fed\\u2019s 2% sweet spot, and the job market remains stubbornly strong, with unemployment at a low 4.1%. For Powell, the challenge is threading the needle: holding rates high enough to keep inflation in check without tipping the economy into a recession. With Trump\\u2019s proposed tariffs lurking in the background, inflation risks aren\\u2019t exactly taking a back seat.\\n\\n**Trump vs. The Fed: The Rematch**  \\n  \\nTrump has made it clear he\\u2019s not a fan of waiting.

Eccles Building is palpable.\\n\\n**The Stakes**  \\n  \\nFed officials are divided. Some, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, think inflation will keep easing, justifying future cuts. Others, like Cleveland\\u2019s Beth Hammack, argue that the Fed needs to keep rates elevated to fight stubborn price pressures. Add Trump\\u2019s tariffs and potential labor market disruptions into the mix, and it\\u2019s a recipe for uncertainty.\\n\\n**What\\u2019s Next?**\\u00a0The Fed is signaling a cautious approach, with a \\u201cwait and see\\u201d stance likely to dominate this week.

Considering that Chinese manufacturing stocks are not really bothered with for US/EU residents, and they are basically in stagnation or levelled out after decades of regular consumerism habits.\\n\\nPerhaps there is a parent company that owns metal mines, crude oil processing, plastic making e.t.c that the tech companies \\\"go to\\\" with long term contracts?\\n\\nTy\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date_Posted\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2024-11-01 10:39:40\",\n        \"max\": \"2025-01-30 21:50:59\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 447,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2025-01-29 20:47:28\",\n          \"2024-12-20 04:24:32\",\n          \"2025-01-17 15:21:41\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Upvotes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1985,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 25041,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 224,\n        \"samples\": [\n          12,\n          80,\n          141\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 258,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2531,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 188,\n        \"samples\": [\n          825,\n          55,\n          394\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Subreddit\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"investing\",\n          \"wallstreetbets\",\n          \"Money\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The move follows a similar one-month delay for tariffs on Mexico, with both countries making commitments to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.\\n\\nThe original plan? 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, with Canadian energy products set for a slightly lower 10% levy. Now, the Canadian tariffs are on hold, with Trump saying he\\u2019ll reassess after seeing progress on border security and drug enforcement efforts.\\n\\n**Canada\\u2019s Counterpunch**  \\n  \\nTrudeau wasn\\u2019t bluffing when he warned of retaliation. Canada had lined up $155 billion in counter-tariffs on U.S. goods, including beer, clothing, and household appliances. Ontario even banned U.S. liquor from shelves (sorry, Tito\\u2019s fans). The Canadian prime minister framed the tariffs as a betrayal, invoking WWII and 9/11 as moments when Canada stood with the U.S.\\u2014not exactly the tone of a friendly trade dispute.\\n\\n**The Market Fallout**  \\n  \\nInvestors breathed a small sigh of relief, but the market remains rattled. Goldman Sachs warned that if tariffs remain in place, S&P 500 earnings could take a 2-3% hit, with automakers, homebuilders, and consumer goods companies among the hardest hit. Car prices could rise by $3,000 on average, homebuilding costs would climb, and Super Bowl guacamole might as well be caviar with avocado prices set to skyrocket.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Trump\\u2019s claim that tariffs would pressure Canada to become the 51st U.S. state (yes, he actually said that) isn\\u2019t exactly making trade negotiations smoother.\\n\\n**What\\u2019s Next?**\\u00a0For now, Trump is giving Canada 30 days to prove it\\u2019s serious about border security and drug enforcement before tariffs go back on the table. Mexico got a similar deal after its president deployed 10,000 soldiers to its northern borderto curb fentanyl shipments.\\n\\nBut if Trump does move forward with tariffs in a month, this could become one of the most aggressive trade wars in modern history\\u2014one that could disrupt $1.4 trillion in trade and send shockwaves through supply chains, consumer prices, and financial markets.\\n\\nStay tuned.

Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google, is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings today, February 4, 2025, after the market closes. Analysts anticipate earnings of $2.13 per share on revenue of $96.7 billion, up from $1.64 per share on $86.3 billion the previous year.\\n\\nI'm really interested in hearing about the company's substantial investments in artificial intelligence and the performance of its cloud services. They have been integrating its latest AI model (Gemini 2.0) across various products and services.\\n\\nGoogle Workspace and Sheets, their AI can now analyze data trends and automatically generating static charts, which can be inserted into spreadsheets Gemini AI is also now embedded within Google Cloud services, offering generative AI tools that enhance creativity and productivity. This integration aids in tasks such as code generation, data analysis, and the development of AI-driven applications. Subscribers to the Google One AI Premium Plan gain access to Gemini Advanced features, including enhanced AI capabilities across Google apps, 2 TB of cloud storage, and other premium services. And of course on Android and Pixel devices, Gemini AI powers features like Expressive Captions, which not only transcribe speech but also capture non-speech elements such as sighs and gasps, providing a more comprehensive understanding of audio content. Their AI is also being integrated into Google Search and the Chrome browser, enhancing the user experience with more intuitive and intelligent features. They claim that this should improve search results, personalized recommendations, and advance browsing capabilities. Maybe.\\n\\nIn the cloud sector, Google Cloud is expected to report a 32% rise in revenue for the fourth quarter, following a 35% increase in the previous quarter. This growth rate surpasses that of competitors like Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services. As of right now the stock has already risen 6.9% this year and 41% over the past twelve months, reflecting investor confidence in the company's strategic direction.\\n\\nAs Alphabet prepares to announce its earnings, I wanna know how the company leverages its AI advancements and cloud services to drive future growth. So with that said, is anyone else playing earnings?\\n\\nNext, I wanted to talk about AMD. They are set to report its fourth-quarter earnings today, From what I've read, analysts anticipate a 22% year-over-year revenue increase to $7.53 billion, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) expected to rise to $1.09 from $0.77 in the same period last year. Just like Google, I'm focused on checking out AMD's advancements in artificial intelligence. The company has recently unveiled several AI-centric products, including the 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors and the AMD Instinct MI325X accelerators, aiming to enhance performance in data centers and enterprise applications.\\n\\nBut despite these innovations, AMD faces challenges in the AI chip market, primarily due to Nvidia's dominance and the trend of major tech companies developing custom silicon. Looking online, it looks like analysts are predicting that AMD's revenue from AI chips could reach $10 billion this year, driven by growth in the data center segment.\\n\\nAnd in the personal computing sector, AMD has expanded its AI capabilities with the introduction of the Ryzen AI 300 Series processors, featuring up to eight \\\"Zen 5\\\" CPU cores and the latest RDNA 3.5 graphics architecture.hese processors aim to deliver enhanced AI performance for consumer and commercial applications.\\n\\nSimilarly to the GOOG call, I will be closely monitoring how the company leverages its AI advancements to drive future growth and compete in the evolving semiconductor landscape.
