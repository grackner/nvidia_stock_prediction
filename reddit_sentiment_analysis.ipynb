With proposed tariffs up to 20% on all imports and a jaw-dropping 100% on goods from China, retailers are facing a fresh dilemma: absorb these costs or pass them onto consumers.\\u00a0\\n\\nAccording to the National Retail Federation (NRF), these tariffs could add up to $7,600 in annual costs for American households, leading to what the NRF warns could be a \\u201ctax on American families.\\u201d Retail stocks like Dollar General and Five Below have already started to feel the heat, dropping as much as 10% this week as they brace for rising expenses and tightening margins.\\n\\n**Consumer Prices in the Crosshairs**\\n\\nRetailers are in a bind: either eat the extra costs or send prices soaring. The NRF predicts these tariffs could zap as much as $78 billion in consumer spending each year if fully enacted. Price hikes in double digits are on the horizon for categories like apparel, electronics, and household items, hitting customers\\u2019 wallets hard.\\u00a0\\n\\nStores that rely heavily on China for sourcing\\u2014like Five Below, Crocs, and Skechers\\u2014are particularly exposed, while discount chains worry that price jumps could scare away budget-conscious shoppers.\\n\\n**Winners, Losers, and Tariff-Proofing Strategies**\\n\\nNot every retailer is biting their nails. Giants like Amazon and Walmart, with massive buying power and diverse supply chains, are poised to weather the tariff storm. Meanwhile, brands like Steve Madden, already seasoned from Trump\\u2019s first tariff stint, have reduced reliance on China by nearly half to sidestep a hit.\\u00a0\\n\\nAs some retailers scramble, those who\\u2019ve diversified early may have a head start in staying ahead of what\\u2019s shaping up to be another trade showdown.\\n\\n# \\n\\n# On The Horizon\\n\\n# Next Week\\n\\nQuick heads-up: the bond market\\u2019s clocking out for Veteran\\u2019s Day on Monday, but stocks are still in action.\\n\\nThe week\\u2019s packed with data drops and Fed chatter.

Google [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google it, right now. Who\\u2019s reporting this? China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the markets don't seem to have a clue.\\n\\nTL;DR: Simply put, I believe the markets have not reacted to China\\u2019s most recent advancements in quantum computing. China is potentially not as far behind the USA as markets would have you believe. I provide here a commentary of recent market movements, in relation to recent quantum computing news and developments. I follow with a more technical discussion of the significance of China\\u2019s advancements, those of US corporations.\\n\\nFinancial disclaimer: While I justify my comments where possible, some of the comments I make in this post are pure speculation. I do not recommend making speculative trades, such as shorting quantum computing, or buying quantum cybersecurity. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.\\n\\nI was astounded to see the latest news dominating the headlines. How did the market not know that China was developing its own language-learning models? I\\u2019m a filthy casual, and even I knew about it. It\\u2019s been in our news at least [since July](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/20/deepseek-v2-0628-released-an-improved-open-source-version-of-deepseek-v2/), and available for use [since September last year](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news0905). It was pretty fucking good back then, too. And there\\u2019s Alibaba\\u2019s Qwenchat, Tencent\\u2019s HunYuan, among numerous others they haven\\u2019t even started talking about yet. What else have they forgotten, in this wild speculative bull run? They probably think the USA is lightyears ahead in quantum computing too. Oh, oh. They do.\\n\\nBefore you go any further, look up [Tianyan-504](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml). Look up [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11924). Google them, right now. They\\u2019re right there, massive Chinese developments both announced in December 2024. The Tianyan-504 surpasses 500 qubits, on par with IBM\\u2019s latest developments. And Zuchongzhi 3.0 demolishes Google\\u2019s earlier Sycamore by all key metrics. Why can\\u2019t we find any article produced by any reputable financial sources, that discuss the significance of these achievements? There is essentially zero market news about it. China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the market has no fucking clue.\\n\\nCheck out D-Wave stock prices, for example. Given their business model relies in part on how they contribute to research in the field, they should be negatively impacted by major research developments in competing economies.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4iggbqnq57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5089134b48021f96baf28b66e5a7dc377b7dee7\\n\\nThis suggests that while Google\\u2019s Willow breakthrough rallied quantum computing stocks and Nvidia\\u2019s CEO pushed them back down, China\\u2019s developments have had zero impact.\\n\\nHow about Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT)? It tells a similar story. Their focus is on fabrication of photonic quantum computing components \\u2013 and again, providing researchers access to quantum computing technology. It looks like Google\\u2019s Willow breakthrough rallied stocks, and Nvidia\\u2019s CEO pushed them back down. China\\u2019s developments have had zero impact.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9dnfa0s57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f77fb7a50a22340541b4c426433ff210c9a7fbe0\\n\\nHow about IBM? News about Google\\u2019s Willow pushed their price down some 3%, which makes good sense. Willow\\u2019s performace blew that of IBM\\u2019s September R2 Heron processor out of the water. Willow is a competitor, but IBM\\u2019s position in the market means they are diversified in so much more than just quantum computing. A small bearish reaction makes perfect sense. So when Tianyan-504 reportedly challenged IBM's benchmarks just three days before Willow did, why didn\\u2019t the stock price move?\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6t1ik5t57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=5377770391681d2bfe3ac54d106217216c3f7feb\\n\\nYou can look at SkyWater Technologies (SKYT), and at Global Foundries (GFS), and Rigetti (RGTI), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), TSM (TSM), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Every one of these key companies relevant to advancing quantum computing in the Western World have one thing in common. When China announces their developments, the markets appear to stay still.\\n\\nThere are three possible reasons for this that I have come up with. There may be other reasons as well that I am not aware of, in which case I encourage you to enlighten me.\\n\\nThe first possible reason is as above: The market is generally not aware. It is likely that some players in the market are aware, and this is a simple piece of information that such players will be taking advantage of \\u2013 they do not have incentive to highlight this knowledge. Furthermore, the market may be uniquely slow to react. Unlike DeepSeek, which we can physically interact with, breaking records in quantum computing research is less tangible, less sensational. Breaking news, markets are irrational.\\n\\nThe second possible reason is simple: China may be lying. I can not find any evidence to support this idea, and China\\u2019s past claims about quantum computing, such as those about [Jiuzhang](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), have been demonstrably true.\\n\\nThe third possible reason is that China\\u2019s quantum computers are not as technically advanced as they sound. Originally I wanted to follow with a full technical discussion about the recent history of Chinese Quantum computing, and the merits of Tianyan-504 and Zuchongzhi 3.0 in comparison to western quantum computing efforts. But since I am not a subject matter expert, and I do not have the time to write in full depth. But I will provide a bit more technical information, summarise and provide references to the academic research for relevant breakthrough technologies, so you can read for yourself.\\n\\nChina is fighting to lead the global race in quantum computing, and [the Chinese government has been investing tens of billions of dollars into quantum computing research](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/04/13/chinese-quantum-companies-and-national-strategy-2023/), alongside the investments of Chinese institutions and corporations.\\n\\nIn 2020 [Jiuzhang, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), was the second quantum computer in the world to achieve quantum supremacy](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), and the first photonic quantum computer to do so. Since then, the university has gone on to create further models of Jiuzhang, and develop chips with greater qubit lifetime and fidelity.\\n\\nIn April 2024, The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics developed their [Xiaohong superconducting chip](https://english.news.cn/20240425/a95b3c190a59486886f4cddc0def31cd/c.html), their most advanced to date, anticipated to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM\\u2019s Heron in key performance metrics including qubit lifetime (how long a qubit can hold its quantum state) and readout fidelity (accuracy in extracting information from qubits). I note the market did not appear to react to the Xiaohong chip either.\\n\\nOn the 13^(th) of November 2024,[ IBM announced their Quantum Heron R2](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), achieving their goal of running quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gates, demonstrating advancements in in qubit lifetime and readout fidelity.\\n\\nOn the 6^(th) of December 2024, [Tianyan-504 was announced](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml), developed by China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., and, built on the Xiaohong chips. China is now the only country to achieve quantum computational advantage through both photonics and superconducting quantum computing technologies. This quantum computer will be incorporated into their quantum computing cloud platform, and made available for researcher purposes.On the 9^(th) of December, [Google\\u2019s Willow was announced](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/). What makes Willow exceptional, is that it provides a breakthrough solution to quantum computing\\u2019s fidelity issue. It exponentially reduces the amount of error while adding more qubits. Presumably Willow can now be scaled further, and I expect to see further developments with adding more qubits now that this challenge has been solved.\\n\\nTwo weeks later, on the 16^(th) of December 2024, an entirely separate research team with the China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. [announced their Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.11924v1#S1). This superconducting quantum computer makes numerous advancements, and demonstrates quantum advantage through speed. It crushes benchmarks set by Google\\u2019s older Sycamore - \\u201cCompared to Google\\u2019s latest experiment, SYC-67 and SYC-70\\u00a0 the classical simulation cost of our 83-qubit, 32-cycle experiment is six orders of magnitude higher.\\u201d Though Zuchongzhi 3.0 does not demonstrate the error correction capability that Willow does, their creators have commented that they believe they can replicate the same techniques in a matter of months.\\n\\nQuantum computing is still twenty years away from being relevant, they say. That gives lots of time for China to catch up. And from what I can understand, China is just one breakthrough away. There are other questions, such as China\\u2019s chip manufacturing capabilities, supply chains for components, that I am unable to find good information on. The US is doing what they can politically, through trade regulation, and restricting financial investment in China\\u2019s technologies. China already has the [lead in quantum communications, and potentially in quantum sensing](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/). But China holds one massive advantage: it\\u2019s regime. In contrast to the American model, where corporations closely guard their own secrets from eachother, [China is claims they invest 15 billion of dollars into coordinated, cohesive research.](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/) And it is showing in their results.\\n\\nEach advancement that China makes in developing its quantum computing capability, ought to remind the market that there is a risk that the lead the US enjoys in quantum computing is being threatened. But look at those google search results again. Outside of technical circles, the western media simply hasn't picked it up. Look at what happened with DeepSeek. I think the markets just don't know. Investors are already anxious about their investments in quantum computing, and are starting to demand returns. Manufacturers are reluctant to scale component production, given the low demand and potential for volatility. So when the market does find out about China\\u2019s achievements in quantum computing, what's going to happen?\\n\\nLet me know what you think.\\n\\nDisclosure of positions:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qlgr3l7w57ge1.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=d480c14a5164357c4a951a0033a861631ea589f8\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date_Posted\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 447,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2025-01-29 20:47:28\",\n          \"2024-12-20 04:24:32\",\n          \"2025-01-17 15:21:41\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Upvotes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1985,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 25041,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 224,\n        \"samples\": [\n          12,\n          80,\n          141\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 258,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2531,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 188,\n        \"samples\": [\n          825,\n          55,\n          394\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Subreddit\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"investing\",\n          \"wallstreetbets\",\n          \"Money\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Google [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google it, right now. Who\\u2019s reporting this? China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the markets don't seem to have a clue.\\n\\nTL;DR: Simply put, I believe the markets have not reacted to China\\u2019s most recent advancements in quantum computing. China is potentially not as far behind the USA as markets would have you believe. I provide here a commentary of recent market movements, in relation to recent quantum computing news and developments. I follow with a more technical discussion of the significance of China\\u2019s advancements, those of US corporations.\\n\\nFinancial disclaimer: While I justify my comments where possible, some of the comments I make in this post are pure speculation. I do not recommend making speculative trades, such as shorting quantum computing, or buying quantum cybersecurity. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.\\n\\nI was astounded to see the latest news dominating the headlines. How did the market not know that China was developing its own language-learning models? I\\u2019m a filthy casual, and even I knew about it. It\\u2019s been in our news at least [since July](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/20/deepseek-v2-0628-released-an-improved-open-source-version-of-deepseek-v2/), and available for use [since September last year](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news0905). It was pretty fucking good back then, too. And there\\u2019s Alibaba\\u2019s Qwenchat, Tencent\\u2019s HunYuan, among numerous others they haven\\u2019t even started talking about yet. What else have they forgotten, in this wild speculative bull run? They probably think the USA is lightyears ahead in quantum computing too. Oh, oh. They do.\\n\\nBefore you go any further, look up [Tianyan-504](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml). Look up [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11924). Google them, right now. They\\u2019re right there, massive Chinese developments both announced in December 2024. The Tianyan-504 surpasses 500 qubits, on par with IBM\\u2019s latest developments. And Zuchongzhi 3.0 demolishes Google\\u2019s earlier Sycamore by all key metrics. Why can\\u2019t we find any article produced by any reputable financial sources, that discuss the significance of these achievements? There is essentially zero market news about it. China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the market has no fucking clue.\\n\\nCheck out D-Wave stock prices, for example. Given their business model relies in part on how they contribute to research in the field, they should be negatively impacted by major research developments in competing economies.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4iggbqnq57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5089134b48021f96baf28b66e5a7dc377b7dee7\\n\\nThis suggests that while Google\\u2019s Willow breakthrough rallied quantum computing stocks and Nvidia\\u2019s CEO pushed them back down, China\\u2019s developments have had zero impact.\\n\\nHow about Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT)? It tells a similar story. Their focus is on fabrication of photonic quantum computing components \\u2013 and again, providing researchers access to quantum computing technology. It looks like Google\\u2019s Willow breakthrough rallied stocks, and Nvidia\\u2019s CEO pushed them back down. China\\u2019s developments have had zero impact.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9dnfa0s57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f77fb7a50a22340541b4c426433ff210c9a7fbe0\\n\\nHow about IBM? News about Google\\u2019s Willow pushed their price down some 3%, which makes good sense. Willow\\u2019s performace blew that of IBM\\u2019s September R2 Heron processor out of the water. Willow is a competitor, but IBM\\u2019s position in the market means they are diversified in so much more than just quantum computing. A small bearish reaction makes perfect sense. So when Tianyan-504 reportedly challenged IBM's benchmarks just three days before Willow did, why didn\\u2019t the stock price move?\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6t1ik5t57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=5377770391681d2bfe3ac54d106217216c3f7feb\\n\\nYou can look at SkyWater Technologies (SKYT), and at Global Foundries (GFS), and Rigetti (RGTI), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), TSM (TSM), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Every one of these key companies relevant to advancing quantum computing in the Western World have one thing in common. When China announces their developments, the markets appear to stay still.\\n\\nThere are three possible reasons for this that I have come up with. There may be other reasons as well that I am not aware of, in which case I encourage you to enlighten me.\\n\\nThe first possible reason is as above: The market is generally not aware. It is likely that some players in the market are aware, and this is a simple piece of information that such players will be taking advantage of \\u2013 they do not have incentive to highlight this knowledge. Furthermore, the market may be uniquely slow to react. Unlike DeepSeek, which we can physically interact with, breaking records in quantum computing research is less tangible, less sensational. Breaking news, markets are irrational.\\n\\nThe second possible reason is simple: China may be lying. I can not find any evidence to support this idea, and China\\u2019s past claims about quantum computing, such as those about [Jiuzhang](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), have been demonstrably true.\\n\\nThe third possible reason is that China\\u2019s quantum computers are not as technically advanced as they sound. Originally I wanted to follow with a full technical discussion about the recent history of Chinese Quantum computing, and the merits of Tianyan-504 and Zuchongzhi 3.0 in comparison to western quantum computing efforts. But since I am not a subject matter expert, and I do not have the time to write in full depth. But I will provide a bit more technical information, summarise and provide references to the academic research for relevant breakthrough technologies, so you can read for yourself.\\n\\nChina is fighting to lead the global race in quantum computing, and [the Chinese government has been investing tens of billions of dollars into quantum computing research](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/04/13/chinese-quantum-companies-and-national-strategy-2023/), alongside the investments of Chinese institutions and corporations.\\n\\nIn 2020 [Jiuzhang, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), was the second quantum computer in the world to achieve quantum supremacy](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), and the first photonic quantum computer to do so. Since then, the university has gone on to create further models of Jiuzhang, and develop chips with greater qubit lifetime and fidelity.\\n\\nIn April 2024, The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics developed their [Xiaohong superconducting chip](https://english.news.cn/20240425/a95b3c190a59486886f4cddc0def31cd/c.html), their most advanced to date, anticipated to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM\\u2019s Heron in key performance metrics including qubit lifetime (how long a qubit can hold its quantum state) and readout fidelity (accuracy in extracting information from qubits). I note the market did not appear to react to the Xiaohong chip either.\\n\\nOn the 13^(th) of November 2024,[ IBM announced their Quantum Heron R2](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), achieving their goal of running quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gates, demonstrating advancements in in qubit lifetime and readout fidelity.\\n\\nOn the 6^(th) of December 2024, [Tianyan-504 was announced](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml), developed by China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., and, built on the Xiaohong chips. China is now the only country to achieve quantum computational advantage through both photonics and superconducting quantum computing technologies. This quantum computer will be incorporated into their quantum computing cloud platform, and made available for researcher purposes.On the 9^(th) of December, [Google\\u2019s Willow was announced](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/). What makes Willow exceptional, is that it provides a breakthrough solution to quantum computing\\u2019s fidelity issue. It exponentially reduces the amount of error while adding more qubits. Presumably Willow can now be scaled further, and I expect to see further developments with adding more qubits now that this challenge has been solved.\\n\\nTwo weeks later, on the 16^(th) of December 2024, an entirely separate research team with the China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. [announced their Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.11924v1#S1). This superconducting quantum computer makes numerous advancements, and demonstrates quantum advantage through speed. It crushes benchmarks set by Google\\u2019s older Sycamore - \\u201cCompared to Google\\u2019s latest experiment, SYC-67 and SYC-70\\u00a0 the classical simulation cost of our 83-qubit, 32-cycle experiment is six orders of magnitude higher.\\u201d Though Zuchongzhi 3.0 does not demonstrate the error correction capability that Willow does, their creators have commented that they believe they can replicate the same techniques in a matter of months.\\n\\nQuantum computing is still twenty years away from being relevant, they say. That gives lots of time for China to catch up. And from what I can understand, China is just one breakthrough away. There are other questions, such as China\\u2019s chip manufacturing capabilities, supply chains for components, that I am unable to find good information on. The US is doing what they can politically, through trade regulation, and restricting financial investment in China\\u2019s technologies. China already has the [lead in quantum communications, and potentially in quantum sensing](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/). But China holds one massive advantage: it\\u2019s regime. In contrast to the American model, where corporations closely guard their own secrets from eachother, [China is claims they invest 15 billion of dollars into coordinated, cohesive research.](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/) And it is showing in their results.\\n\\nEach advancement that China makes in developing its quantum computing capability, ought to remind the market that there is a risk that the lead the US enjoys in quantum computing is being threatened. But look at those google search results again. Outside of technical circles, the western media simply hasn't picked it up. Look at what happened with DeepSeek. I think the markets just don't know. Investors are already anxious about their investments in quantum computing, and are starting to demand returns. Manufacturers are reluctant to scale component production, given the low demand and potential for volatility. So when the market does find out about China\\u2019s achievements in quantum computing, what's going to happen?\\n\\nLet me know what you think.\\n\\nDisclosure of positions:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qlgr3l7w57ge1.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=d480c14a5164357c4a951a0033a861631ea589f8\\n\\n\",\n          \"* Tech stocks took a beating Monday as China\\u2019s DeepSeek AI debuted a model that rivals U.S. counterparts at a fraction of the cost, sending shockwaves through the Nasdaq, which dropped over 3%.

U.S. tech stocks lose a cool $1 trillion, and Nvidia logs the biggest single-day market cap wipeout in history. Enter DeepSeek, the new kid on the AI block, proving you don\\u2019t need billion-dollar budgets or cutting-edge chips to shake up the industry.\\n\\n**AI\\u2019s New MVP**  \\n  \\nDeepSeek\\u2019s latest AI model, R1, developed in just two months for under $6 million, is outperforming its American counterparts in benchmarks.

($TSLA)\\n\\n# \\n\\n# Fed Faces 2025 with Rates on Lock\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve kicks off its first meeting of 2025 this week, and despite Trump\\u2019s not-so-subtle nudging, don\\u2019t hold your breath for any rate cuts. Jerome Powell and his crew are expected to keep the key rate at 4.3%, marking a cautious pause after last year\\u2019s three consecutive reductions.\\n\\n**Why the Pause?**  \\n  \\nInflation is cooling\\u2014but not enough. Prices are hovering at 2.4%, just above the Fed\\u2019s 2% sweet spot, and the job market remains stubbornly strong, with unemployment at a low 4.1%. For Powell, the challenge is threading the needle: holding rates high enough to keep inflation in check without tipping the economy into a recession. With Trump\\u2019s proposed tariffs lurking in the background, inflation risks aren\\u2019t exactly taking a back seat.\\n\\n**Trump vs. The Fed: The Rematch**  \\n  \\nTrump has made it clear he\\u2019s not a fan of waiting. Last week at Davos, he said he\\u2019d \\u201cdemand\\u201d lower rates, calling out Powell by name (again) and claiming he knows interest rates \\u201cbetter than they do.\\u201d For now, Powell isn\\u2019t taking the bait, but the tension between 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and the Marriner S. Eccles Building is palpable.\\n\\n**The Stakes**  \\n  \\nFed officials are divided. Some, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, think inflation will keep easing, justifying future cuts. Others, like Cleveland\\u2019s Beth Hammack, argue that the Fed needs to keep rates elevated to fight stubborn price pressures. Add Trump\\u2019s tariffs and potential labor market disruptions into the mix, and it\\u2019s a recipe for uncertainty.\\n\\n**What\\u2019s Next?**\\u00a0The Fed is signaling a cautious approach, with a \\u201cwait and see\\u201d stance likely to dominate this week. But don\\u2019t expect Trump to stay quiet\\u2014he\\u2019s already hinted at future clashes with Powell, whose term runs until 2026. Whether rates hold, drop, or\\u2014brace yourself\\u2014rise, the stage is set for a high-stakes game of monetary policy tug-of-war.\\n\\n# On The Horizon\\n\\n# Tomorrow\\n\\nTomorrow\\u2019s lineup is stacked with economic updates: the consumer confidence index, the S&P Case-Shiller home price index, and durable goods orders are all on deck. Plus, the Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day FOMC meeting. While we\\u2019ll have to wait until Wednesday for any rate decision, expect plenty of chatter about what Jerome Powell and team are cooking up.\\n\\nEarnings season stays busy with names like Boeing ($BA), Lockheed Martin ($LMT), General Motors ($GM), Royal Caribbean ($RCL), Kimberly-Clark ($KMB), and Chubb ($CB) taking the stage. JetBlue Airways ($JBLU) will test the airline sector\\u2019s hot streak, while Starbucks ($SBUX) looks to reverse three straight quarters of declining sales under its new CEO. Shareholders in both will be watching closely to see if they can deliver\\u2014or disappoint.\\n\\n# Before Market Open:\\n\\n* **JetBlue Airways**\\u00a0($JBLU) is flying into turbulence ahead of its earnings report. Despite a banner earnings season for airlines, analysts aren\\u2019t feeling optimistic\\u2014six say \\u201chold\\u201d and four say \\u201csell.\\u201d The skepticism centers on JetBlue\\u2019s towering debt-to-equity ratio, dwindling cash flow, and mounting operating losses. Investors are crossing their fingers that robust consumer demand and the broader industry\\u2019s momentum can carry the airline higher. Expectations are set at -$0.31 EPS on $2.26 billion in revenue.\\n\\n# After Market Close:\\n\\n* **Starbucks**\\u00a0($SBUX) is brewing more than coffee\\u2014it\\u2019s trying to find its identity under CEO Brian Niccol. With three consecutive quarters of declining sales and sliding customer transactions, shareholders are banking on Niccol to deliver a turnaround. The chain is grappling with balancing its corporate behemoth status with its neighborhood-friendly vibe. Anything short of a rebound could send the stock steeply lower. Analysts are eyeing $0.68 EPS on $9.32 billion in revenue.\",\n          \"I'm a newbie and was thinking about this randomly, the collective spiderweb of how money moves through the investment world.

($NVDA)\\n\\n# \\n\\n# Honda and Nissan Might Merge to Take on the Big Dogs\\n\\nHonda and Nissan\\u2014two of Japan\\u2019s auto heavyweights\\u2014are reportedly kicking the tires on a potential merger that could reshape the global car game. The alliance would create a combined force capable of challenging Toyota at home and Tesla, plus those nimble Chinese EV makers abroad.\\n\\n**From Rivals to Ride-Sharers**\\n\\nTalks are still in the \\u201cwhat if we\\u2026\\u201d phase, but reports suggest the companies could form a shared holding company. Nissan\\u2019s 24% stake in Mitsubishi means the smaller automaker might join the party too, turning this into Japan\\u2019s most significant automotive shakeup since your dad gave up his stick shift. Together, the trio could clock 8 million vehicles a year, still a few laps behind Toyota\\u2019s 11 million, but enough to put some pressure on the global leaders.\\n\\nFor Nissan, it\\u2019s a much-needed tow. The automaker\\u2019s operating income nosedived 90% this year amid struggles in the U.S. and China. Honda, meanwhile, has been hustling to keep its EV ambitions alive while wrestling with rising development costs. A merger could streamline production and tech investment\\u2014two essentials for staying relevant in the EV race.\\n\\n**The Toyota Problem**\\n\\nToyota has been eating everyone\\u2019s lunch, pulling smaller players like Subaru, Suzuki, and Mazda under its wing to dominate the EV-hybrid market. A Honda-Nissan team-up could help level the playing field. Think shared EV batteries, consolidated R&D, and enough scale to punch back against Tesla and China\\u2019s BYD, which are sprinting ahead in electric cars.\\n\\nStill, merging two fierce rivals is easier said than done. There\\u2019s overlap in their lineups, deep cultural differences, and, you know, decades of competition. As one analyst quipped, \\u201cThey might share the road, but they\\u2019re not always driving in the same direction.\\u201d\\n\\n**Markets Hit the Gas**\\n\\nInvestors love a comeback story, and Nissan\\u2019s stock surged 22% on the news, while Honda\\u2019s dipped 1.2%, as traders weighed the risk of pairing two struggling players.\\n\\nIf this sounds like d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 vu, that\\u2019s because Nissan\\u2019s been here before. Its long and messy relationship with France\\u2019s Renault ended in a complicated corporate divorce. Now, Nissan\\u2019s searching for a new partner to help it avoid stalling out.\\n\\n**The Big Picture:**\\u00a0In an EV era where bigger equals better, this potential merger underscores a simple truth: carmakers need scale to survive. If Honda and Nissan can pull this off, they\\u2019d become the David to Toyota\\u2019s Goliath\\u2014a true heavyweight challenger in a market where the only real sin is being too small to matter.\\n\\n# \\n\\n# Market Movements\\n\\n* \\ud83e\\udd16\\u00a0**Salesforce Eyes Robot Future:** Salesforce has secured\\u00a0over 1,000 paid deals for its AI-powered platform \\\"Agentforce,\\\"\\u00a0CEO Marc Benioff announced.

($SDZ)\\n\\n# \\n\\n# Dow\\u2019s Nine-Day Slide \\u2014 Is It Really That Bad?\\n\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average just wrapped up its ninth straight losing day, marking its longest skid since 1978. While headlines scream \\u201chistoric slump,\\u201d the story under the hood isn\\u2019t quite as dire\\u2014though it might feel like a blast from the Carter administration.\\n\\n**What\\u2019s Dragging the Dow Down?**\\n\\nLet\\u2019s talk about the index\\u2019s biggest weight: UnitedHealth Group. Shares of the healthcare giant have tumbled 21% since December 4th, when tragedy struck with the fatal shooting of its insurance CEO, Brian Thompson. Combine that with President-elect Trump\\u2019s recent vow to \\u201cknock out\\u201d healthcare middlemen like UnitedHealth, and you\\u2019ve got a recipe for investor panic.\\n\\nBut UnitedHealth isn\\u2019t alone. Cyclical stocks like Sherwin-Williams and Caterpillar\\u2014which surged post-election on hopes for deregulation and infrastructure spending\\u2014have since lost steam. Even Nvidia, a star player in 2024, is down 10% during the slump.\\n\\n**Not All Markets Are Moping**\\n\\nHere\\u2019s the kicker: the Dow\\u2019s funk isn\\u2019t dragging everyone down. The S&P 500 is holding strong near record highs, and the Nasdaq Composite hit an all-time high just yesterday, thanks to megacap tech\\u2019s ongoing dominance. Stocks like Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple are all thriving, but their wins barely register in the Dow\\u2019s quirky price-weighted formula, where share price matters more than market value.\\n\\nIn other words, the Dow\\u2019s losses aren\\u2019t a reflection of the broader market\\u2014it\\u2019s more of an index anomaly.\\n\\n**So, Should You Worry?**\\n\\nHere\\u2019s a little perspective: the Dow is only down 3.5% from its December 4th highs. That\\u2019s not even close to a correction, which kicks in at a 10% drop. More importantly, history is on investors\\u2019 side. December\\u2019s second half typically sees markets recover as traders ride seasonal trends into the new year.\\n\\nPlus, Wall Street pros remain optimistic about 2025. If anything, this dip could be a \\u201cpause that refreshes,\\u201d as some strategists like to say\\u2014especially with the Federal Reserve decision on deck this week.\\n\\n**The Takeaway:**The Dow\\u2019s nine-day losing streak may look grim, but let\\u2019s not confuse noise with signals. Tech stocks are booming, the broader market is in good shape, and this pullback might just be a breather before the bulls take over to close out 2024.\\n\\nSo breathe easy, Dow-watchers.\\n\\n# \\n\\n# On The Horizon\\n\\n# Tomorrow\\n\\nSure, tomorrow we'll get some housing stats\\u2014like new builds and building permits\\u2014to gauge where the real estate supply is heading. But let's face it, the main event is the Fed.\\n\\nThe Federal Open Market Committee is wrapping up its last meeting of the year, and the market's betting big (over 95% odds) on another interest rate cut. But here's the kicker: this might be the final slice for a while, especially with 2025's uncertainties casting a shadow. Jerome Powell's words have been market movers all year, so tomorrow's decision feels like the grand finale in this monetary saga.\\n\\n# After Market Close:\\u00a0\\n\\n* **Micron Technology**\\u00a0has been lagging behind its semiconductor peers, but investors are banking on brighter days ahead. Unlike Nvidia, Micron doesn\\u2019t make GPUs; it\\u2019s all about the memory market, where demand is expected to boom as AI continues to evolve. Wall Street hasn\\u2019t lost faith despite a sluggish year\\u201423 out of 24 analysts still have a \\u201cbuy\\u201d rating on the stock, with just one cautious \\u201chold\\u201d in the mix. Now it\\u2019s up to Micron to prove them right. Consensus: $1.76 EPS, $8.55 billion in revenue. ($MU)\",\n          \"https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-ces-2025-blackwell-gaming-17697a0e\\n\\nDespite the focus on the company\\u2019s AI data center products the past year, the chip maker is still releasing its latest processor technologies to boost the PC gaming experiences for consumers.\\n\\nOn Monday, Nvidia unveiled its next generation gaming graphic cards at the CES tech trade show in Las Vegas. The company\\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, announced the coming RTX 5090 card and three other models, all of which will use \\u201cBlackwell\\u201d architecture chips.\\n\\n\\u201cBlackwell, the engine of AI, has arrived for PC gamers,\\u201d Huang said.\\n\\nThe RTX 5090 will sell for $1,999, while the 5080, 5070 Ti, and 5070 will cost $999, $749, and $549, respectively. The 5090 and 5080 will be available on Jan. 30, while the other cards will be available starting in February.\\n\\nThe RTX 50 Series cards will also support Nvidia\\u2019s fourth generation DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology, which boosts performance by rendering images at lower resolutions and then using artificial intelligence to reconstruct details at higher resolutions. A Nvidia executive says DLSS 4.0 uses the latest AI transformer models to improve image quality.\\n\\nNvidia says the RTX 5090 will outperform the prior generation\\u2019s RTX 4090 by up to two times when using DLSS 4.0.\\n\\nHuang also announced an AI desktop computer named Project DIGITS, which runs a Linux-based operating system and incorporates a GB10 Blackwell Superchip that can deliver up to 1 petaflop of AI performance.\\n\\n\\u201cPlacing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI,\\u201d Huang said.\\n\\nProject DIGITS will be available in May, starting at $3,000.\\n\",\n          \"Before I start, I want to preface this by acknowledging the memes and negative connection between intel and the one guy who lost his grandma's funds, but I genuinely believe with how low st. expectations are, combined with intel's massive sell-off these few months, Intel will skyrocket leading up/during the ER @ 1/30/2025.\\n\\n# 1. Extremely heavy Investments in Manufacturing\\n\\n* **Tens of Billions Invested**: Intel has invested heavily in manufacturing expansion, aiming to regain technological leadership. These investments are expected to start bearing fruit by 2026 and 2027, positioning Intel as a key U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturer.\\n   * Now I know ya'll are gonna complain, but that's 2026 and 2027, which is a long ways out! Here's the thing, as long as (they will) Intel acknowleges their progress towards manufacturing, and the expected returns of their investments, especially under the current administration, the upside will be more or less priced in within the report.\\n* **Alignment with U.S. Government Priorities**: U.S. policy encourages domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, especially with the new Mango administration.\\n   * It's pretty obvious that the current admin wants to become less dependent on foreign semiconductor manufacturing, and Intel's investments in the space PLUS mango being in power will undoubtedly be great for the stock, and I believe that's what Intel will lean into heavily during the upcoming earnings report with stellar guidance.\\n\\n# 2. Undervalued Stock Price\\n\\n* **Current Valuation**: Intel is trading at one of its lowest forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios of the year, at around 20.\\n* **Intrinsic Value**: Updated discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation indicates an intrinsic value of $36 per share, significantly higher than the current trading price of $19.82. While there may be some other factors, this suggests Intel is trading on a pretty steep discount compared to its market value, way less than other big names.\\n\\n# 3. Advanced Developments\\n\\n* **Advanced Node Development**: Intel is investing in advanced manufacturing nodes to close the gap with competitors like TSMC and Samsung. Success in these nodes will make Intel competitive in high-margin markets.\\n   * I'll admit, I'm not entirely familiar with the development process of these, but I can't imagine this not being bullish for the stock.\\n* **Gaudi AI Chips**: The release of competitive AI chips (e.g., Gaudi 3) positions Intel to capture a share of the rapidly growing AI market.\\n\\n# 4. Reduced Competition in Dual Design-Manufacturing Model\\n\\n* **Unique Positioning**: Intel and Micron remain the only U.S.-based companies pursuing both design and manufacturing, while most competitors focus on design alone. This vertical integration could yield huge advantages as Intel scales.\\n   * Again, I'm not familiar with the development of chips, but from what I could find, if Intel could pull this off in the long-run, it'll set itself in an extremely unique environment with both design and manufacturing WITHIN the United States. Would be huge for the nation-first agenda under the current administration.\\n\\n# 5. Support from Geopolitical Tailwinds\\n\\n* **CHIPS Act Benefits**: Intel is set to benefit from U.S. government incentives under the CHIPS Act, including grants and tax credits for domestic semiconductor manufacturing.\\n   * Again, huge for a US-based company like Intel.\\n\\n# 6. Potential Leadership Turnaround\\n\\n* **CEO Transition**: A change in leadership could bring new strategic clarity and execution capability, particularly in aligning investment timelines with profitability goals.\\n   * Though Pat was a pretty chill guy, if Intel could bring in someone with large amounts of industry experience, that's another huge upside potential for Intel. They may announce a new CEO during ER or somewhere near it, but I just can't imagine them settling with a mid-tier guy after what they've been through.\\n\\n# 7. Market Share Opportunities\\n\\n* **Competitor Weaknesses**: AMD and Nvidia focus on niche areas, leaving room for Intel to grow in data centers, personal computing, and automotive applications.\\n   * Yes, this does mean that their areas would be very hard to break into, but we've already seen Intel turning around in some aspects, especially their newer desktop gaming GPUs which actually bring in surprising value for performance beyond AMD and Nvidia comparable cards.\\n* **U.S. Government Contracts**: Intel\\u2019s U.S.-based manufacturing advantage makes it a preferred supplier for defense and other government projects, which is yet another large catalyst for the future.\\n\\n# 8. Focused Financial Discipline\\n\\n* **Cost Reductions**: Intel has paused dividends and reduced workforce to save over $10 billion by 2025, stabilizing its financial position during this investment-heavy period.\\n   * I expect to see this being reflected upon in the upcoming 1/30 ER. With a bit more cash freed up and stabilizing finances, I'm pretty confident that it'll be far beyond what the market has been pricing in which is arguably a worst case doomsday scenario.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nYes, Intel does have a decent amount of debt. Yes, nana's son did lose hundreds of thousands. But it's objectively true that INTC has been beaten down mercilessly these past few months, with a 56% drawdown since the start of 2024. It's entirely possible- likely even- that this is a far overreaction, especially with INTC taking steps to improve leadership, control debts, free up cash, and invest in what's needed. Combine that with the new administration that went into power yesterday, focusing on heavy domestic production, I believe Intel will be the surprise overperformer for this year.\\n\\nNFA. I hold around $10k in calls expiring next month after the ER, and I am planning on DCAing aggressively into shares to hold for a few years.\\n\\n[T](https://preview.redd.it/jmpxjozifgee1.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=15c4f3a652f7e8b44bdedaaf0a9075939f3cf952)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date_Posted\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 363,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-12-04 19:13:21\",\n          \"2025-01-16 02:18:51\",\n          \"2025-01-28 05:02:31\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Upvotes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1318,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 15740,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 178,\n        \"samples\": [\n          875,\n          216,\n          5233\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 244,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1998,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 160,\n        \"samples\": [\n          48,\n          651,\n          37\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Subreddit\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"investing\",\n          \"wallstreetbets\",\n          \"Money\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.5009151686894258,\n        \"min\": -0.9387,\n        \"max\": 0.9998,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 298,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9224,\n          0.944,\n          0.8957\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment Category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Positive\",\n          \"Negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The data analytics firm posted a 36% jump in Q4 revenue to $828 million, smashing analyst expectations, while U.S. commercial sales skyrocketed 64%. If that wasn\\u2019t enough, CEO Alex Karp predicted \\u201cuntamed organic growth\\u201d in AI demand, leading Palantir to raise its full-year revenue outlook to $3.75 billion, well above Wall Street\\u2019s $3.54 billion projection.

The move follows a similar one-month delay for tariffs on Mexico, with both countries making commitments to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.\\n\\nThe original plan? 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, with Canadian energy products set for a slightly lower 10% levy. Now, the Canadian tariffs are on hold, with Trump saying he\\u2019ll reassess after seeing progress on border security and drug enforcement efforts.\\n\\n**Canada\\u2019s Counterpunch**  \\n  \\nTrudeau wasn\\u2019t bluffing when he warned of retaliation. Canada had lined up $155 billion in counter-tariffs on U.S. goods, including beer, clothing, and household appliances. Ontario even banned U.S. liquor from shelves (sorry, Tito\\u2019s fans). The Canadian prime minister framed the tariffs as a betrayal, invoking WWII and 9/11 as moments when Canada stood with the U.S.\\u2014not exactly the tone of a friendly trade dispute.\\n\\n**The Market Fallout**  \\n  \\nInvestors breathed a small sigh of relief, but the market remains rattled. Goldman Sachs warned that if tariffs remain in place, S&P 500 earnings could take a 2-3% hit, with automakers, homebuilders, and consumer goods companies among the hardest hit. Car prices could rise by $3,000 on average, homebuilding costs would climb, and Super Bowl guacamole might as well be caviar with avocado prices set to skyrocket.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Trump\\u2019s claim that tariffs would pressure Canada to become the 51st U.S. state (yes, he actually said that) isn\\u2019t exactly making trade negotiations smoother.\\n\\n**What\\u2019s Next?**\\u00a0For now, Trump is giving Canada 30 days to prove it\\u2019s serious about border security and drug enforcement before tariffs go back on the table. Mexico got a similar deal after its president deployed 10,000 soldiers to its northern borderto curb fentanyl shipments.\\n\\nBut if Trump does move forward with tariffs in a month, this could become one of the most aggressive trade wars in modern history\\u2014one that could disrupt $1.4 trillion in trade and send shockwaves through supply chains, consumer prices, and financial markets.\\n\\nStay tuned. This saga is far from over.\\u00a0\\n\\n# On The Horizon\\n\\n# Tomorrow\\n\\nThe week kicks off with a spotlight on labor market data, starting with the job openings report. November's 8.1 million job openings and a 4.8% openings rate signaled a robust hiring environment, and economists are eyeing December's numbers for similar strength. But for anyone rooting for a Fed rate cut, a little softness in the data wouldn\\u2019t hurt.\\n\\nTuesday brings a heavyweight lineup of earnings from across industries.

Stocks tumbled at the open after President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. However, the market found a lifeline mid-morning when Mexico brokered a last-minute deal to delay its tariffs for a month, easing some of the immediate pressure.\\n* The S&P 500 slid 0.8%, the Dow shed 122 points after recovering from a 665-point plunge, and the Nasdaq lost 1.2%. Despite the rebound, tensions remained high as Canada vowed to retaliate with tariffs on $105 billion of U.S. goods, setting the stage for continued market volatility.\\n\\n# Winners & Losers\\n\\n# What\\u2019s up\\u00a0\\ud83d\\udcc8\\n\\n* **Triumph**\\u00a0soared 33.94% after announcing it will be acquired by private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Berkshire Partners for $3 billion.

The data analytics firm posted a 36% jump in Q4 revenue to $828 million, smashing analyst expectations, while U.S. commercial sales skyrocketed 64%. If that wasn\\u2019t enough, CEO Alex Karp predicted \\u201cuntamed organic growth\\u201d in AI demand, leading Palantir to raise its full-year revenue outlook to $3.75 billion, well above Wall Street\\u2019s $3.54 billion projection.

U.S. government sales spiked 45% to $343 million, thanks to expanded contracts with the Army and Special Operations Command. Meanwhile, Karp\\u2019s vision for an AI-powered defense industry is taking shape\\u2014Palantir inked a partnership with AI startup Anthropic to bring its language models into U.S. intelligence operations, while deepening ties with weapons maker Anduril.

Big tech and big defense are merging, and Palantir is at the center of it all.\\n\\n**A Political Tailwind for Palantir**  \\n  \\nInvestor enthusiasm for Palantir has surged since Trump\\u2019s return to the White House, with expectations that his administration will double down on defense spending and favor U.S. tech firms over foreign competitors. Palantir has positioned itself as a key player in this vision\\u2014Chief Technology Officer Shyam Sankar recently outlined a blueprint to revitalize U.S. manufacturing and defense technology, while Karp has been vocal about the need for the U.S. to maintain technological dominance. Citing political scientist Samuel Huntington, Karp argued that global power has historically been shaped by technological and military strength\\u2014a stance that reinforces Palantir\\u2019s role in securing America\\u2019s AI and defense future.\\n\\n**What\\u2019s Next? More AI, More Government $$$**  \\n  \\nPalantir expects U.S. commercial sales to jump another 54% in 2025 and is still raking in major government contracts, including a $619 million Army deal through 2028. But it\\u2019s also navigating a shifting AI landscape, especially after China\\u2019s DeepSeek debuted an AI model that rattled U.S. tech stocks. Karp is unfazed, telling CNBC that America needs an \\u201call-country effort\\u201d to maintain its edge.

The move follows a similar one-month delay for tariffs on Mexico, with both countries making commitments to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.\\n\\nThe original plan? 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, with Canadian energy products set for a slightly lower 10% levy. Now, the Canadian tariffs are on hold, with Trump saying he\\u2019ll reassess after seeing progress on border security and drug enforcement efforts.\\n\\n**Canada\\u2019s Counterpunch**  \\n  \\nTrudeau wasn\\u2019t bluffing when he warned of retaliation. Canada had lined up $155 billion in counter-tariffs on U.S. goods, including beer, clothing, and household appliances. Ontario even banned U.S. liquor from shelves (sorry, Tito\\u2019s fans). The Canadian prime minister framed the tariffs as a betrayal, invoking WWII and 9/11 as moments when Canada stood with the U.S.\\u2014not exactly the tone of a friendly trade dispute.\\n\\n**The Market Fallout**  \\n  \\nInvestors breathed a small sigh of relief, but the market remains rattled. Goldman Sachs warned that if tariffs remain in place, S&P 500 earnings could take a 2-3% hit, with automakers, homebuilders, and consumer goods companies among the hardest hit. Car prices could rise by $3,000 on average, homebuilding costs would climb, and Super Bowl guacamole might as well be caviar with avocado prices set to skyrocket.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Trump\\u2019s claim that tariffs would pressure Canada to become the 51st U.S. state (yes, he actually said that) isn\\u2019t exactly making trade negotiations smoother.\\n\\n**What\\u2019s Next?**\\u00a0For now, Trump is giving Canada 30 days to prove it\\u2019s serious about border security and drug enforcement before tariffs go back on the table. Mexico got a similar deal after its president deployed 10,000 soldiers to its northern borderto curb fentanyl shipments.\\n\\nBut if Trump does move forward with tariffs in a month, this could become one of the most aggressive trade wars in modern history\\u2014one that could disrupt $1.4 trillion in trade and send shockwaves through supply chains, consumer prices, and financial markets.\\n\\nStay tuned. This saga is far from over.\\u00a0\\n\\n# On The Horizon\\n\\n# Tomorrow\\n\\nThe week kicks off with a spotlight on labor market data, starting with the job openings report. November's 8.1 million job openings and a 4.8% openings rate signaled a robust hiring environment, and economists are eyeing December's numbers for similar strength. But for anyone rooting for a Fed rate cut, a little softness in the data wouldn\\u2019t hurt.\\n\\nTuesday brings a heavyweight lineup of earnings from across industries. Expect updates from Pfizer ($PFE), PayPal ($PYPL), Spotify ($SPOT), PepsiCo ($PEP), Chipotle ($CMG), Snap ($SNAP), and Ferrari ($RACE), to name just a few.

I was lucky enough to make a decent amount from AMC stock and decided to use some of those extra funds to learn options trading. I lost about $5,000 in one week and didn\\u2019t touch options again until about a year and a half ago.\\n\\nWhen I restarted, I focused on learning the basics and buying smaller amounts. I would fund my account with $300 to $1,000 and usually blow through it within a month. After funding my account multiple times and losing about $4,000 overall while \\u201clearning\\u201d how to trade options, I had a realization: Most of my losses came from losing conviction and selling early for a loss rather than averaging in responsibly and following through. My market prediction rate is moderately high, I just needed discipline. \\n\\nHence, 2025. New year, new trading me.\\n\\nStarted off the year with about $1300 in the account and my gains are about $6300 for the month of January. My trading technique is very simple. I only trade a few tickers where I study the charts, but I watch all top holdings of the S&P for general market trends. I also only utilize MACD, RSI, VWAP and Volume indicators, awaiting for basic oversold/overbought signals.\\n\\nNow, I love watching charts across all markets 24/7. After some years of observing trends and missing opportunities that I foresaw, my confidence in trading has grown. I now average into my positions rather than impulsively buying with half or most of my portfolio. I minimize losses by selling when a limit has been reached. And most importantly, controlling my emotions while I trade. My goal is realistically $200 a day, with an end of the year account total of $25k. Hoping I can surpass this much sooner if I can continue the trend.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Despite a strong performance in its financial performance, AMD expects first-quarter data center sales that may fall short of expectations, raising doubts about AMD's competitiveness amid Nvidia's dominance in the AI GPU sector.\",\n          \"Doesn\\u2019t it use NVIDIA to train their LLMs as well as run their service?
