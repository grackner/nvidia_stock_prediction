Intel's revenue forecast disappoints as investors await new CEO,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1idxsqq/intels_revenue_forecast_disappoints_as_investors/,"Intel's (INTC.O), opens new tab first-quarter revenue forecast on Thursday missed analyst estimates, as the chipmaker grapples with tepid demand for traditional data center chips and declining share in the key personal computer market.

Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company fell close to 2% in volatile extended trading. Last year, Intel's shares lost about 60%.

As the chipmaker undergoes a historic transition and attempts to emerge from one of its bleakest periods, it has also struggled to cash in on a boom in investment in advanced AI chips - a market led by Nvidia.

In its quarterly report after the bell, Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $11.7 billion to $12.7 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $12.87 billion according to data compiled by LSEG.

Companies looking to capitalize on generative AI technology have prioritized spending on specialized AI processors that can churn huge amounts of data, crimping demand for the traditional server processors that Intel sells.

The company's outlook ""reflects seasonal weakness magnified by macro uncertainties, further inventory digestion and competitive dynamics,"" interim co-CEO and chief financial officer David Zinsner said in a statement.

Intel last year scrapped a 2024 forecast that it would sell over $500 million worth of its new AI processors, named Gaudi, suggesting they struggled to compete against Nvidia's chips.

On an adjusted, per-share basis, Intel forecast it would break-even for the current quarter. Analysts expect adjusted profit of 9 cents per share.

It is spending heavily to become a contract manufacturer of chips for other companies, leading some investors to worry about pressure on its cash flows.

Former CEO Pat Gelsinger was ousted last month, leaving two temporary co-CEOs at the helm and shrouding Intel's turnaround strategy in uncertainty.

Intel reported fourth-quarter revenue fell 7% from a year earlier to $14.26 billion, beating estimates of $13.81 billion.

The PC market - Intel's largest by revenue share - saw global shipments rise only modestly last year, underperforming analysts' expectations of a strong rebound after months of declines.

The company has also been losing share in the PC and server CPU market to rival AMD.

Nvidia’s Prime time to buy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1idqhfo/nvidias_prime_time_to_buy/,"
Stocks are emotional in nature. The Nvidia incident is no different.

I understand why tech took a big hit, the idea that something just became even 20x cheaper is crazy new advancement and could be what makes AI very profitable and productive.

The nvidia stock going down I believe was an overreaction. One thing to consider is that yes you now don’t need the best chips, but you still need chips and you may need a lot more now that the price has become so much more attractive. 

Keep in mind as well nvidia over 10 years has increase the efficiency and power of the chip by 2-3x.

Now there might be a demand for maybe not the newest chips but one that can be mass produced. 

Nvidia owns 98percent of the chip market. This reaction should’ve only happened had they overnight lost their monopoly.

I believe it’s a great time to buy as of current being at 119. 

It’s impossible to predict if it’ll go up or down however I’m optimistic about Nvidia buy more than I was the past year. 

Another thing I will
Mention is when did we ever start blindly believe government funded projects like DeepSeek from China and how much it actually cost and how much time was actually spent. Many of these questions are still a mystery. Either way I don’t think it’s a bad thing for Us tech…it just means they get to copy that format and continue making innovations 

Pessimists will say ai bubble has bursted 

Optimism will get you into denial mindsets 

But looking at the data and picking it up for what I consider cheap for a good company is I think a good play 

I’ll likely sell when it hits 135 and rebounds after people pick up their hats.

These are the stocks on my watchlist (01/30),https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ido021/these_are_the_stocks_on_my_watchlist_0130/,"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**

**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Offhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)



[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

**Related tickers:** (Mentioned above)

# [S&P 500 futures rise after Meta Platforms, Tesla report earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures rose Thursday as Wall Street digested recent quarterly results from a slew of megacap tech companies. Investors are coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve held steady on rates.
*****
> Futures tied to the broad market index added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were fractionally lower.
*****
> Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla gained 1% and 2%, respectively, while Microsoft shares dipped more than 4% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company’s quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. On the other hand, revenue misses from UPS and Caterpillar weighed the indexes down.
*****
> Other “Magnificent Seven” names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple’s results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week.
*****
> On Wednesday, all three major averages ended the session lower as a 4% decline in Nvidia weighed on the market. The declines came after the Fed paused its interest rate-cutting campaign, leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their post-meeting statement, policymakers noted that inflation remains “somewhat elevated.”
*****
> “The implication is that we’re on hold until the inflation rate goes down, and unfortunately it’s probably not going to go down very much in the several months ahead, so I wouldn’t be looking for rate cuts at the next meeting,” Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “We have a relatively stable place where we’re standing, and it kind of supports the fact that the market is in a calm position right now, and so is [Jerome] Powell apparently,” he said.
*****
> On the economic data front, the fourth-quarter gross domestic product reading is due on Thursday, and weekly jobless claims are out in the morning. Investors are also looking ahead to Friday’s personal consumption expenditures price index report for December.

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors await Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were near the flatline on Wednesday as investors turned toward the first Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2025.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched down 13 points. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.3% higher, while S&P 500 futures was trading around the flatline.
*****
> Tech stocks on Tuesday led the S&P 500 higher and brought the Nasdaq Composite to a 2% gain. The two indexes made a comeback after incurring sharp losses on Monday in a sell-off spurred by the emergence of China’s DeepSeek and the threat it poses to the artificial intelligence trade. Nvidia, which suffered a roughly 17% decline Monday, jumped nearly 9% on Tuesday.
*****
> “As far as the DeepSeek news over the weekend, at the end of the day today, there really hasn’t been that much of an impact on a market-wide basis,” Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> The Fed’s interest rate decision on Wednesday is now a focal point for investors, as well as Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. Fed funds futures data reflect a nearly 100% certainty that the central bank will keep rates steady at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group data.
*****
> “When it comes to the Fed, they’re widely not expected to do anything tomorrow and that’s a good thing. The less the Fed has to do, the better it is for the market, in our view,” Hickey added.
*****
> Investors will be paying especially close attention to Powell’s comments — his first press conference in President Donald Trump’s second term. The two have had a contentious relationship dating back to Trump’s first term. The president has already said he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”
*****
> A volley of Big Tech earnings are due Wednesday afternoon, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla issuing their quarterly reports.

Buying in the dip : ok ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ict25h/buying_in_the_dip_ok/,"Hi everyone

  
i've got some hesitation. I always wanted to pick 2-3 stock in pure AI tech to boost my exposition on US tech.  I've got 50-60% Tech ETF (world tech and nasdaq). But i would like to bet on 2-3 picks which can make the difference in 2025 and the dip is ""exciting"",  but i feel like a doubt in the market.

My watchlist about tech :

\- Arista network

\- Purestorage

\- Synopsys

\- Vertiv

Some says Broadcomm and Marvell look ""risky"" after the dip... I got Nvidia but Trump tarriff and the trouble about the cost of AI chipset in the context where big investor criticize more and more the yield of IA... So i guess in the medium term, nvidia will be less profitable. 

So what do you think ? the last time i took 2 stock pick, i lost 10% in two day (AMD et Cheniere), so i would like to get more advice lol

  
Thank you",2025-01-29 12:52:17,13,24,stocks

Is SMCI SMUGGLING NVIDIA GPUS to CHINA?!?!?,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1icmat5/is_smci_smuggling_nvidia_gpus_to_china/,"Gather 'round, I've stumbled upon some juicy DD that's bad news for any $SMCI bulls.

Yesterday, a video surfaced on X, of a Chinese entrepreneur bragging about getting 200 NVIDIA H200 GPUs despite the export ban, claiming that he's done so for the past 5 year.

But where the story gets really interesting is when the video shows him pulling the NVIDA H200s out from a fresh delivery, which clearly shows $SMCI logo on the boxes he received...

https://preview.redd.it/di3dhpvf6vfe1.png?width=1249&format=png&auto=webp&s=a958013deb8bf7b78988c8b6b3918e733a99a43f

Now before any $SMCI bulls go panic-denial mode, let's put this into context:

* \*\*2018:\*\*$SMCI gets yeeted off Nasdaq for ""losing"" its financial statements. 
* **2020: SEC Slapdown:** $17.5 million fine for widespread accounting violations. The bill is paid, and 3 months later $SMCI rehires the same execs directly involved in the fraud numbers
* **2024:**
   * Hindenburg drops a DD bomb, accusing them of *still* mishandling their numbers, even accusing SMCI of ""violations in US export bans""... interesting
   *  Ernst & Young resign as SMCI's auditor after raising concerns about the company's accounting practices, board management... maybe they picked up on rumors of an additional revenue stream that was hidden in the books as well, who knows.
* **Lawsuits, Lawsuits Everywhere:** Ex-employees whisteblowers continue reporting falsified revenue numbers and other sus accounting practices. 10-k gets ""misplaced"", nice one

And now this video. Definitely not the PR $SMCI needs right now.

Could this be a coincidence? Unlikely. But sure, let's assume $SMCI is just an innocent pawn in this Chinese GPU smuggling game without ever realizing, the accusation alone could trigger a huge sell off. DeepSeek's roll out sent a wake up to the US: we've lost the lead in our own game. The China-US Ai competition has now taken central focus of the government and stock market alike, so imagine how this news will impact an already-beaten down stock with new accusations cropping up each week.",2025-01-29 05:02:20,364,77,stocks
Bridgewater sees short-term correction for tech stocks but bullish on DeepSeek impact By Reuters,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1icbxeu/bridgewater_sees_shortterm_correction_for_tech/,"""Bridgewater sees short-term correction for tech stocks but bullish on DeepSeek impact""

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bridgewater-sees-shortterm-correction-for-tech-stocks-but-bullish-on-deepseek-impact-3834767



  Hedge fund manager Bridgewater Associates said Chinese startup DeepSeek's launch of its latest artificial intelligence (AI) models could lead to a short-term correction in many tech companies' share prices but is positive for the industry.

The comments come amid a tech stocks sell-off prompted by the release of a free AI assistant launched by DeepSeek last week that the startup said uses less data at a fraction of the cost of services currently available.

DeepSeek's AI Assistant has overtaken rival ChatGPT to become the top-rated free application available on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the United States, raising doubts about the reasoning behind some U.S. tech companies' decision to pledge billions of dollars in AI investment.

""DeepSeek’s progress is big news, but not bad news for most of the AI ecosystem,"" Bridgewater said in a note on Monday authored by Co-Chief Investment Officer Greg Jensen and Jas Sekhon, chief scientist of AIA Labs, a division within the hedge fund focused on developing and utilizing AI and machine learning technologies to generate investment strategies and insights.

DeepSeek threatens share prices for many tech stocks in the short term, Bridgewater said.

""This may be especially true for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), because DeepSeek’s success may encourage companies to invest more in achieving efficiency gains by optimizing how AI software interacts with the hardware,"" said the note.

Shares in Nvidia, a leader in the AI chip market, fell 17% on Monday, wiping $593 billion from its market value - a record one-day loss for any company - and dragged U.S. stocks lower. That drop was partly corrected on Tuesday, with Nvidia shares up around 5% in premarket trading.

> Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump plans to impose tariffs on imported computer chips, pharmaceuticals and steel, he said on Monday, to push companies to manufacture more in the United States.
> 
> The comments mark the latest in a number of trade-related threats unleashed by Trump in recent days. He has already promised to slap 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico by Feb. 1 if the two countries don't meet demands on border security and other issues.
> 
> By focusing on chips and pharmaceuticals, Trump could squeeze U.S. allies in Asia, including Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.
> 
> **WHAT'S BEING TARGETED FOR CHIPS?**
> 
> Trump said he plans to impose tariffs on imported computer chips without providing details.
> Asia is the world's biggest chip manufacturing hub, producing more than 80% of semiconductors sold globally, according to the Asian Development Bank.
> 
> Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chipmaker, makes semiconductors for Nvidia, Apple and other U.S. clients. TSMC generated 70% of its revenue in 2024 from customers based in North America.
> 
> While it is building a $65 billion manufacturing facility in Arizona, the bulk of TSMC's production remains in Taiwan, with exports to the U.S. theoretically subject to tariffs.

> 
> Asian producers also dominate the market for memory chips, with DRAM and NAND flash chips used in electronic devices including computers.
> 
> South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix together control around three quarters of the global DRAM market.
> 
> The two companies, plus Japan's Kioxia, which is controlled by U.S. buyout firm Bain Capital, command a similar market share in NAND flash.
> 
> Samsung is investing roughly $44 billion in chipmaking facilities in Texas with subsidies from the U.S. government.
> 
> **WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC HIT?**
> 
> Chips are a major source of export revenue for South Korea and Taiwan, meaning there's a lot more at stake than just the impact on manufacturers themselves.
> 
> South Korea's exports of semiconductors hit a record $141.9 billion in 2024, of which $10.28 billion was to the U.S., according to data released by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy earlier this month.
> 
> **WHAT ABOUT OTHER CHIP SUPPLY CHAIN COMPANIES?**
> 
> Japan is a major supplier of chipmaking equipment and materials, all of which, at least for now, appear to have avoided direct mention by Trump. Major equipment companies include Tokyo Electron and Advantest.
> 
> **WHAT ABOUT PHARMA?**
> 
> Imposing tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could weigh on Japan, home of major drugmakers such as Takeda, Astellas, Daiichi Sankyo and Eisai, which has been expecting strong sales growth in the U.S. of its Alzheimer's disease drug Leqembi.
> 
> For Takeda, the U.S. market accounted for just over half of its revenue in last financial year, while for Astellas it accounted for 41%. In both cases it wasn't clear how much of the U.S. revenue came from imports.
> 
> In a statement, Astellas said it was always preparing for geopolitical risks to ensure a stable supply of products. It also said it had invested in multiple manufacturing sites in the U.S. and would continue to do so.",2025-01-28 20:14:06,427,79,stocks
"Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is already using DeepSeek instead of OpenAI at his startup, Gloo",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ic98l6/former_intel_ceo_pat_gelsinger_is_already_using/,"DeepSeek’s new open source AI reasoning model, R1, sparked a sell-off of Nvidia’s stock and caused its consumer app to soar to the top of the app stores.
Last month DeepSeek said it trained a model using a data center of some 2,000 of Nvidia’s H800 GPUs in just about two months at a cost of around $5.5 million. Last week, it published a paper showing that its latest model’s performance matched the most advanced reasoning models in the world. These models are being trained in data centers that are spending billions on Nvidia’s faster, very pricey AI chips.
The reaction across the tech industry to DeepSeek’s high-performance, lower-cost model has been wild. Pat Gelsinger, for instance, took to X with glee, posting, “Thank you DeepSeek team.” 


Gelsinger is, of course, the recently former CEO of Intel, a hardware engineer, and current chairman of his own IPO-bound startup, Gloo, a messaging and engagement platform for churches. He left Intel in December after four years and an attempt at chasing Nvidia with Intel’s alternative AI GPUs, the Gaudi 3 AI.
Gelsinger wrote that DeepSeek should remind the tech industry of its three most important lessons: lower costs mean wider-spread adoption; ingenuity flourishes under constraints; and “Open Wins. DeepSeek will help reset the increasingly closed world of foundational AI model work,” he wrote. OpenAI and Anthropic are both closed source.
Gelsinger told TechCrunch that R1 is so impressive, Gloo has already decided not to adopt and pay for OpenAI. Gloo is building an AI service called Kallm, which will offer a chatbot and other services.
“My Gloo engineers are running R1 today,” he said. “They could’ve run o1 — well, they can only access o1, through the APIs.” 

Instead, in two weeks, Gloo expects to have rebuilt Kallm from scratch “with our own foundational model that’s all open source,” he said. “That’s exciting.”
He said he thinks DeepSeek will make AI so affordable, AI won’t just be everywhere. Good AI will be everywhere. “I want better AI in my Oura Ring. I want better AI in my hearing aid. I want more AI in my phone. I want better AI in my embedded devices, like the voice recognition in my EV,” he says. 
Gelsinger’s happy reaction was perhaps at odds with others who were less thrilled that reasoning foundational models now have a higher-performing and far more affordable challenger. AI has been growing more expensive, not less.
Others reacted by implying DeepSeek must have fudged its numbers somehow and training must have been more costly. Some thought it couldn’t say it used higher-end chips because of U.S. AI chip export restrictions to China. Others were poking holes in its performance, finding spots where other models did better. Still others believe that OpenAI’s next model, o3, will so outpace R1 when it is released that the status quo will be repaired.
Gelsinger shrugs all of that off. “You will never have full transparency, given most of the work was done in China,” he said. “But still, all evidence is that it’s 10-50x cheaper in their training than o1.”
DeepSeek proves that AI can be moved forward “by engineering creativity, not throwing more hardware power and compute resources at the problem. So that’s thrilling,” he said.
As for this being a Chinese developer with all that implies, like concerns over privacy and censorship, Gelsinger metaphorically shakes his head.

Trading ETFs when market dips?,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ic4pkw/trading_etfs_when_market_dips/,"I had an idea of trading ETFs, meaning when the market is somewhat stable, you have all your money in e.g. All World, otherwise when the market has a significant crash, for example in the tech industry with NVIDIA right now, you sell your shares of All World and buy the dip of a more volatile ETF like the Tech S&P500. Since the Tech industry quickly recovers, you sell a couple days later then buy the stable All World again.
Isn't this a less risky strategy that allows to take in some profit, rather than just going all in in the normal S&P500 or just straight up trading stocks?

# [S&P 500 futures are flat as Nvidia attempts to rebound from AI stock rout: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures were relatively unchanged early Tuesday, following a sell-off fueled by worries over the emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek and its greater implications for the artificial intelligence trade.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500, along with Nasdaq 100 futures, traded just above the flatline, rising 0.1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were also flat.
*****
> Futures were trading in step with Nvidia in the premarket, with both trading off their highs during the session. Nvidia added around 2% after suffering a nearly 17% decline on Monday, which resulted in a market cap loss of nearly $600 billion — the biggest one-day drop for a U.S. company in history. Broadcom and Oracle also traded higher by more than 2% and around 1%, respectively.
*****
> Concerns over DeepSeek came to a head on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite losing more than 3%, while the S&P 500 slid about 1.5%. The Chinese startup last month unveiled a free open-source large language model that it says took less than $6 million to build. The development spurred worries around Big Tech’s investment into AI. DeepSeek surpassed rival OpenAI on Monday to become the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store.
*****
> “Valuations remain extended, and while vulnerabilities were expected this year, developments like DeepSeek highlight the need for diversification beyond the Mag Seven,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. “The 2025 theme of US exceptionalism is now facing uncertainty, with ongoing concerns around tariffs and inflation adding to market challenges.”
*****
> Investors’ attention is turning toward corporate earnings due this week. Starbucks is due to report Tuesday after the bell. A slate of Magnificent Seven companies will report in the coming days, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple due later this week.
*****
> The Federal Reserve will also kick off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 99% chance that interest rates will remain unchanged, according to CMEGroup’s FedWatch Tool. Inflation data out Friday will give investors further insight on the health of the U.S. economy.

"Trump To Tariff Chips Made In Taiwan, Targeting TSMC",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ibqaz5/trump_to_tariff_chips_made_in_taiwan_targeting/,"President Trump plans to impose tariffs of up to 100% on chips produced in Taiwan, targeting companies like TSMC, which supplies Apple, Nvidia, and AMD. The tariffs aim to encourage more chip production in the US, with Trump criticizing the CHIPS and Science Act for providing funds to companies that already have significant resources. The policy may cause price hikes for various computer products, as it takes years to build chip factories. TSMC-made chips are typically not exported directly to the US, but rather sent to other countries for assembly into consumer electronics. The implementation of such tariffs will depend on US trade officials.

"Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ibkcex/nvidia_sheds_almost_600_billion_in_market_cap/,"Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.

The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

The selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. 

Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”

The analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”

But after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.

Data center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.

For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.

Nvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.

CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.

The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.

Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.

“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.

Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

70% of AI workloads will shift to real-time inference by 2030 (McKinsey) - What stocks benefit?,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ibhe81/70_of_ai_workloads_will_shift_to_realtime/,"This was published 3 days ago so not sure if it was coincidence or triggered by the Deepseek panic. But it's certainly timely:

>While training current advanced AI models requires immense computing resources, the shift towards real-time decision-making - known as inferencing - is poised to drive massive demand for additional computing power. According to McKinsey, 60-70% of AI workloads are expected to shift to real-time inference by 2030, creating an urgent need for low-latency connectivity, compute and security at the edge beyond current demand.

Note that this is a [Verizon press release](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-unveils-ai-strategy-power-next-gen-ai-demands), so take it with a grain of salt. (I tried looking for the original McKinsey article but didn't find it).

Assuming this projection is true, what stocks will benefit? 

* Telecom? AT&T went up big today?
* Apple and other mobile related stocks?
* Edge computing and cybersecurity?

I asked Perplexity and this was the result:

* NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): NVIDIA is a leading player in edge computing and AI-optimized processors15. Its EGX Edge Computing Platform offers a comprehensive solution combining hardware and software for various edge computing applications1.

* Arista Networks (ANET): Arista has developed a growing business providing network equipment for small, on-site data centers and infrastructure software for managing local networks enabled by edge computing2.

* Nutanix (NTNX): Nutanix offers hardware for cloud and edge computing, with its hyper-converged technology ensuring high performance and agility for edge computing users2.

* Ambarella (AMBA): Ranked as a top edge AI stock for 2025, Ambarella focuses on developing specialized hardware for edge computing applications3.

* Cloudflare (NET): Strategically positioned at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and edge computing, Cloudflare is well-placed to benefit from these trends5.

* Accenture plc (ACN): Accenture's ""Accenture One Edge Platform"" provides a unified solution for managing Cloud-Edge-IoT computing, positioning it to benefit from the growing demand for edge computing services7.",2025-01-27 19:16:17,130,50,stocks

Love to get everyone's take in case there's a big fire sale this week.

**Mag 7 Winners**

* Apple: This is where their lag in AI investment actually helps them. Now they can build better AI for their mobile devices, computers, home services, and their version of Omniverse at a much lower cost. 

* Google, which invested in their own cheaper chips instead of the Nvidia chips. Also has the most integrated AI stack which means they have more ability to adapt. 
* Amazon, same as Google but to a lesser degree.

**Financial**

* Cheaper model training cost means a lot more startups will gain meaningful access to AI, creating a lot more exciting use cases. More startup success means more M&A.

**Software**

* Cheaper model training cost also means the cost of companies running AI agents/software will also pay a lot less. They can pass on savings to customers, invest even more into R&D, and accelerate their agentic AI.

* Some picks off top of my head: Salesforce, cyber security stocks like PANW or Crowdstrike, Palantir, or just $IGV. 

**Healthcare / Drug Development**

* There should be less demand for Nvidia chips, making it cheaper for these industries to gain more (and cheaper) access to GPU.

>“DeepSeek shows that it is possible to develop powerful AI models that cost less,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. “It can potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain, which is driven by high spending from a small handful of hyperscalers.”

>Founded by quant fund founder Liang Wenfeng, the app’s underlying AI model is widely seen as competitive with OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc.’s latest. Lauded by investor Marc Andreessen as “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs,” DeepSeek’s assistant shows its work and reasoning as it addresses a user’s written query or prompt. Reviews on Apple’s app store and on Alphabet Inc.’s Android Play Store praised that transparency.

>Nasdaq 100 futures tumbled as much as 1.9%, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell as much as 1%. The moves represent continued losses from Friday’s cash session, as US shares cooled after gains earlier in the week as President Donald Trump took office.

>In contrast, stocks advanced in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng Tech Index climbing as much as 2% ahead of Lunar New Year holidays this week. Chinese AI-related stocks including Merit Interactive Co. surged by their daily limits. Merit is among those with the clearest links to DeepSeek after stating in an earlier filing that it had incorporated the homegrown AI firm’s model into marketing.

>Meanwhile, shares in the AI supply chain slumped as investors rethink their assumptions that the most advanced AI will require increasing amounts of computing power and energy. Major Nvidia supplier Advantest Corp., slid as much as 8.6% in Tokyo. Data centers shares also slipped, with Singapore-listed Mapletree Industrial Trust down 3.6%. Markets were closed for holidays in Taiwan and South Korea.

>The DeepSeek product “is deeply problematic for the thesis that the significant capital expenditure and operating expenses that Silicon Valley has incurred is the most appropriate way to approach the AI trend,’ said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer and internet at Singapore-based Aletheia Capital. “It calls into question the massive resources that have been dedicated to AI.”

>Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.com, says the updated AI model unveiled by China’s DeepSeek raises concerns about geopolitical risks as well as questions about US tech stock valuations.

>The decline in Nasdaq futures comes at the start of a big week for earnings from major tech companies including Apple and Microsoft Corp. Profit growth is expected to have slowed while valuations remain inflated, once again causing concern over the large AI-driven rally in the sector.

>The Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 estimated forward earnings, compared with its three-year average of 24 times. Nvidia is at 33 times, though that’s slightly down from its three-year average. Shares of Nvidia were more than 3% lower on the alternative trading system Blue Ocean in Asia morning, according to Kok Hoong Wong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities

>The DeepSeek release raises new doubts, challenging the notion that China’s AI technology is years behind US counterparts. Washington’s trade restrictions had kept the most cutting-edge chips out of China’s hands, but DeepSeek’s model was built using open source technology that is easy to access.

>“While current leaders like Nvidia have a strong foothold, it is a reminder that AI dominance cannot be taken for granted,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. “The emergence of China’s DeepSeek indicates that competition is intensifying, and although it may not pose a significant threat now, future competitors will evolve faster and challenge the established companies more quickly. Earnings this week will be a huge test.”

S&P500 vs individual stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iaoa6o/sp500_vs_individual_stocks/,"Hi all,
Apologies for the maybe stupid question.

I have started investing about 1 year ago almost all of it (if not all) into well diversified ETFs like SXR8 and SPYY (yes, I know they overlap but I wanted to make it a little bit more USA heavy).

Now, I have really been wanting to invest into stocks and, of course, do the due diligence of learning about it. As I am still on the basics I can't help myself but ask, even long term, is SPY a better bet than, let's say, AAPL?
I understand that sometimes picking the ""good"" stock is difficult, but even 10 years ago Apple was among the companies with the highest market cap and still managed to outperform the index.

So I have 2 stupid questions based on this:
1. In your opinion, might this continue to happen in the future? Not necessarily apple but alphabet, Microsoft, nvidia or Meta are safer bets than Spy?
2. What are your recommendations on where to learn about investing into individual stocks, not say trading but more middle term (I believe it's called swing trading?)

Thanks in advance!",2025-01-26 19:47:36,29,41,stocks
Is it weird to feel like there’s nothing good to invest in?,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ia91f2/is_it_weird_to_feel_like_theres_nothing_good_to/,So now that I finally have some money to invest at 40 I feel like there’s nothing great to invest in. AI is so nebulous and intangible that it doesn’t seem like there’s anything one thing for solid growth there. To be clear I understand there is growth to be had particularly with nvidia and the like. But I don’t see any facebooks or amazons or new explosions of growth in the market. Don’t get me wrong I know it’s not something that everybody sees before hand.

TSM vs Nvidia,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i8usl1/tsm_vs_nvidia/,"Obviously, Trump announcing he'll invest $500 billion into AI is a big boom for Nvidia. But how will Trump's tariffs impact Nvidia's future sells? 

That got my thinking - what company would benefit from Trump's announcement while being immune from his tariffs? The conclusion I came to is TSMC (TSM).

Nvidia, and pretty all tech companies in the world, contracts TSMC (TSM) to make their semiconductors and chips for them. If Nvidia sales improve, TSMC's sales will improve. And because TSMC is a Taiwanese company, they're not going to be impacted by Trump's tariffs...unless Trump decides to put tariffs on Taiwan which seems unlikely.

What does everyone think? Is TSM a better investment than Nvidia?",2025-01-24 12:58:53,0,27,stocks
Nvidia Zero-Day Options Are the Next Big Bet for ETF Upstart,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i7j5al/nvidia_zeroday_options_are_the_next_big_bet_for/,">The ETF industry’s upstart-in-chief is back with another roll of the new-product dice — this time betting on a game-changing expansion of Wall Street’s zero-day options boom.

>Matt Tuttle, who struck gold with leveraged meme-stock funds but fell flat with his Jim Cramer ETFs, has filed to create a line of new offerings that will trade fast-twitch derivatives on popular companies beloved by the retail-investing masses. Think Nvidia Corp., Tesla Inc., MicroStrategy Inc. and more.

>The gamble? Publicly traded single-stock options aren’t available on a daily basis, meaning 0DTE bets can currently only occur on a Friday when weekly, monthly and quarterly contracts expire. Yet Tuttle says he is convinced it’s a matter of time before derivatives tied to individual companies shift to daily expiry.

>“Whether that’s three months from now, six months from now, two years from now, I have no idea,” the Tuttle Capital Management CEO said. “My thinking is if I do believe that’s going to happen, I want to be first in line for it.”

>In the meantime, Tuttle has come up with a workaround for his new ETFs, which could launch in the first half of the year provided the Securities and Exchange Commission doesn’t object. They’ll trade so-called Flex options — customized contracts that allow users to set terms such as strike prices and expiration dates — and roll them on a daily basis. Such contracts can be listed on exchanges without approvals in advance, Tuttle said.

>America’s dynamic $11 trillion ETF industry is no stranger to investment strategies being prepared before demand, feasibility or even regulatory approval is assured. Increasingly complicated strategies featuring diverse leverage and return targets are being packaged into the easily traded wrapper and sold to the masses.

>Tuttle is seeking to capitalize on two hot but controversial trends on Wall Street: Selling options to generate income, and trading those with zero days to expiration, or 0DTE. His firm plans a series of so-called 0DTE covered-call ETFs targeting mostly technology megacaps including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp.

>To Ben Johnson, head of client solutions at Morningstar, the industry’s emphasis on first-mover advantage and apparent indifference to the risks of many strategies highlight the growing competition between firms for new business.

>“Another blast from the ETF industry’s spaghetti cannon, a shot fired in hopes that a few of these products might stick to the wall,” Johnson said. Sponsors are “clearly not all that interested in whether these products actually have any long-term investment merit,” he said.

>The concept of an ETF using 0DTE options is not new. The likes of Defiance ETFs and Roundhill Investments have launched ETFs focused on indexes such as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 that aim to harvest income from zero-day contracts. But almost three years after derivatives on indexes and ETFs began expiring daily, the same change has yet to be made for single-stock options.

>Unlike S&P 500 index options that are proprietary to Cboe Global Markets — the trading venue at the center of the 0DTE craze — listing single-stock zero-day contracts would be an industry-wide effort, said a spokesperson at the exchange.

>Tuttle attracted widespread attention in 2021 when he launched a fund betting against Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF. While his attempt to ride the fame of Cramer, the host of CNBC’s Mad Money show, sputtered in short order, his foray into super-leveraged single-stock ETFs produced some of 2024’s biggest hits.

>“The ETF industry is very clever about finding workarounds, to buy time until the real thing is ready,” Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, said of the proposed funds. “In the end, how the sausage is made isn’t that important to investors. They just care that they’re getting this sort of cool hot sauce and end product.”

**Thoughts on this:** ETFs that become massive from investors not understanding the risks are nothing new (XIV, we shall never forget thee) but this will lead to interesting trading situations when there's dislocation between these theorized 0-DTE underlying ETFs and security itself. I can foresee a situation where 0-DTEs are massively overvalued/undervalued compared to what the underlying should theoretically be and then take a arbitrage position on these (assuming that the ETF is liquid). Guess they really want that options gambling money from the people who can't get approved to trade options.

"Trying to figure out where in the business stack to make my bed: New OpenAI Datacenters in Abilene, Texas",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i74sbu/trying_to_figure_out_where_in_the_business_stack/,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here, so I apologize if it's elementary.

I've invested long term in the defense sector companies and ETF's, and I'm looking to take a more proactive role in my trades with my new capital. I heard about this big joint Stargate deal and I wanted more information before I start building an investment portfolio.  
  
I read that the Data Centers are already being built in Abilene, Texas and started thinking of which part of this deal would be the best to invest in. There are the investors: MDX, Softbank, Blue Owl Capital, and Microsoft; The tech infrastructure players: Nvidia, OpenAI, Broadcom, TSMC, Oracle; And then the physical building & energy infrastructure that I'm most interested in.  
  
My thought process is: Regardless of whether or not the OpenAI deal follows through or not, builders and energy companies in the area will be getting a lot of money coming their way.  
I wasn't able to find any specific mentions of who is contracted to build out these Datacenters, who will be providing the electricity, nor whether they're publicly traded so I can invest. Any information about them, or how to find the ""back-end"" of these deals specifically, and which companies/ETF's may get boosted by proximity or direct involvement is really appreciated, thank you guys.

TSMC net profit hits record high as fourth-quarter results top expectations on robust AI chip demand,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i2n6hd/tsmc_net_profit_hits_record_high_as_fourthquarter/,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s fourth-quarter revenue and profit beat expectations, as demand for advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications continued to surge.

Here are TSMC’s fourth-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Net revenue: 868.46 billion New Taiwan dollars ($26.36 billion), vs. NT$850.08 billion expected
Net income: NT$374.68 billion, vs. NT$366.61 billion expected

TSMC profit rose 57% from a year earlier to a record high, while revenue jumped 38.8%. The firm had forecast fourth-quarter revenue between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion.

As the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer TSMC produces advanced processors for clients such as Nvidia and Apple and has benefited from the megatrend in favor of AI.

TSMC’s high-performance computing division, which encompasses artificial intelligence and 5G applications, drove sales in the fourth quarter, contributing 53% of revenue. That HPC revenue was up 19% from the previous quarter.

“The surging demand for AI chips has exceeded expectations in Q4,” Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research told CNBC, adding that revenue was also bolstered by demand for the advanced chips in Apple’s latest iPhone 16 model.

The Taiwan-based company first released its December revenue last week, bringing its annual total to NT$ 2.9 trillion — a record-breaking year in sales since the company went public in 1994.


“We observed robust AI related demand from our customers throughout 2024,” Wendell Huang, chief financial officer and vice president at TSMC, said in an earnings call on Thursday, adding that revenue from AI accelerator products accounted for “close to a mid-teens percentage” of total revenue in 2024.

“Even after more than tripling in 2024, we forecast our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025 as a strong surge in AI-related demand continues as a key enabler of AI applications,” Huang added.

However, TSMC may face some headwinds in 2025 from U.S. restrictions on advanced semiconductor shipments to China and uncertainty surrounding the trade policy of President-elect Donald Trump.

TSMC Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei said the company will not attend Trump’s inauguration as its philosophy is to keep a low profile, Reuters reported.

Trump, who will assume office next week, has threatened to impose broad tariffs on imports and has previously accused Taiwan of “stealing” the U.S. chip business. .

Still, Counterpoint’s Wang forecasts 2025 to be another strong year for TSMC, with significant revenue growth fueled by strong and expanding demand for AI applications, both in diversity and volume.

Taiwan-listed shares of TSMC gained 81% in 2024 and were trading 3.75% higher on Thursday.

Stocks of European semiconductor companies trading on the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange rose Thursday, with ASML
 up 3.5%, ASM International
 gaining 3.75% and Besi
 rising 5.1%.

Novice Question on Profit Percentages (E-Trade),https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i24630/novice_question_on_profit_percentages_etrade/,"Hello, quick question from someone with minimal knowledge.  I purchased stocks back in 2020-21 for the first time and then left them.  Some have appreciated in value nicely, but I noticed an interesting discrepancy. 

When I look at my ""watch list"" on E-Trade for Broadcom, which I placed on the list during the crash 3/23/20, I see that the ""change in value"" is +9000% since that date according to the app.  This is slightly bigger than Nvidia over the same period.   However, I bought the stock within a month of that time, and it has ""only"" appreciated about 700% in value since then.  

I'm perfectly happy with the investment, but I was curious what explains the 10x discrepancy between the watch list change and the tax lot gain for roughly the same period.  I imagine part of it is that I didn't buy at rock bottom - but is that it?

The role of ROCm in AMD's future,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i1fe4x/the_role_of_rocm_in_amds_future/,"I've recently bought some AMD shares because the share price does not seem to reflect the progress they are making on the hardware front.

I'm considering buying more shares but I find it hard to pull the trigger because the adoption of ROCm seems to be lacking.

I've tried to get a sense of ROCm vs. CUDA usage in as many ways as I could find:

\- Google search trends  
\- Github statistics of the official ROCm repository  
\- Github statistics of the TensorFlow and PyTorch library  
\- Package manager statistics of ROCm related packages (including TensorFlow and PyTorch)  
\- Dockerhub statistics of ROCm related images

I understand that these statistics are not going to reflect the reality but they do give an (albeit indirect) sense of the difference in adoption.

It seems that CUDA easily has 10X more usage and activity than ROCm and I currently don't see how AMD is going to be able to turn that around.

If AMD AI related hardware stays on par with Nvidia's counterparts or only slightly outperforms them, there is nearly no incentive for companies to make the switch to ROCm unless they use unforked TensorFlow or PyTorch solutions.

Large companies usually operate on forked versions of these frameworks to suit their own particular needs and are also highly likely to have several projects directly integrating with CUDA which makes the switch to ROCm very costly.

How large a role do you guys think the adoption of ROCm will play in the future of AMD and how do you see AMD incentivizing large companies to make the switch from CUDA?",2025-01-14 20:17:01,32,19,stocks
S&P’s $18 Trillion Rally Threatened by Psychology of 5% Yields,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hztlvw/sps_18_trillion_rally_threatened_by_psychology_of/,">For years it’s seemed like nothing could stop the stock market’s inexorable march higher, as the S&P 500 Index soared more than 50% from the start of 2023 to the end of 2024, adding $18 trillion in value in the process. Now, however, Wall Street is seeing what can ultimately derail this rally: Treasury yields above 5%.

>Equities traders have shrugged off the bond market’s warnings for months, focusing instead on the windfall from President-elect Donald Trump’s promised tax cuts and the seemingly limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence. But the risk came into focus last week as Treasury yields climbed toward their ominous milestones and share prices sank in response.

>The yield on 20-year US Treasuries breached 5% on Wednesday and jumped back above on Friday, reaching the highest since Nov. 2, 2023. Meanwhile, 30-year US Treasuries briefly crossed 5% on Friday to the highest since Oct. 31, 2023. Those yields have risen roughly 100 basis points since mid-September, when the Federal Reserve started reducing the fed funds rate, which has come down 100 basis points over the same time.

>“It is unusual,” Jeff Blazek, co-CIO of multi-asset strategies at Neuberger Berman, said of the dramatic and rapid jump in bond yields in the early months of an easing cycle. Over the past 30 years, intermediate and longer-term yields have been relatively flat or modestly higher in the months after the Fed initiated a string of rate cuts, he added.

>Traders are watching the policy-sensitive 10-year Treasury yield, which is the highest it’s been since October 2023 and is rapidly approaching 5%, a level they fear could spark a stock market correction. It last passed the threshold briefly in October 2023, and before that you have to go back to July 2007.

>“If the 10-year hits 5% there will be a knee-jerk reaction to sell stocks,” said Matt Peron, Janus Henderson’s global head of solutions. “Episodes like this take weeks or maybe a few months to play out, and over the course of that the S&P 500 could get to down 10%.”

>The reason is fairly simple. Rising bond yields make returns on Treasuries more attractive, while also increasing the cost of raising capital for companies.

>The spillover into the stock market was apparent on Friday, as the S&P 500 tumbled 1.5% for its worst day since mid-December, turned negative for 2025, and came close to wiping out all the gains from the November euphoria sparked by Trump’s election.

>While there’s “no magic” to the fixation on 5% beyond round-number psychology, perceived barriers can create “technical barriers,” said Kristy Akullian, Blackrock’s head of iShares investment strategy. Meaning, a swift move in yields can make it difficult for stocks to rise.

>Investors are already seeing how. The earnings yield for the S&P 500 is sitting 1 percentage point below what’s offered by 10-year Treasuries, a development last seen in 2002. In other words, the return on owning a significantly less risky asset than the US equities benchmark hasn’t been this good in a long time.

>“Once yields get higher it becomes harder and harder to rationalize valuation levels,” said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede Trust. “And if earnings growth starts to falter, there can be issues.”

>Not surprisingly, strategists and portfolio managers predict a bumpy road ahead for stocks. Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson anticipates a tough six months for equities, while Citigroup’s wealth division told clients there’s a buying opportunity in bonds.

>The path to 5% on the 10-year Treasury became more realistic on Friday after strong jobs data caused economists to reduce expectations for rate cuts this year. But this isn’t just about the Fed. The selloff in bonds is global and based on sticky inflation, hawkish central banks, ballooning government debts, and extreme uncertainties presented by the incoming Trump administration.

>“When you’re in hostile waters, yields above 5% is where all bets are off,” Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert, said.

>What equity investors need to know now is if, and when, serious buyers step in.

>“The real question is where we go from there,” said Rick de los Reyes, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. “If it’s 5% on its way to 6% then that’s going to get people concerned, if it’s 5% before stabilizing and ultimately going lower then things will be fine.”

>Red Flags

>The key isn’t so much that yields are rising, but why, market pros say. A slow increase as the US economy improves can help stocks. But a quick jump due to concerns about inflation, the federal deficit and policy uncertainty is a red flag.

>In recent years, whenever yields have risen quickly, stocks have sold off. The difference this time appears to be complacent investors, as seen in bullish positioning in the face of frothy valuations and uncertainties about Trump’s policies. And that’s putting equities in a vulnerable position.

>“When you look at rising prices, a strong job market and an overall strong economy, it all points to a possible uptick in inflation,” said Eric Diton, president of the Wealth Alliance. “And that’s not even including Trump’s policies.”

>One area that may prove to be a haven for equity investors is the group that’s been driving most of the gains these past few years: Big Tech. The so-called Magnificent Seven companies — Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. — are still posting rapid earnings growth and massive cash flows. Plus, looking to the future, they’re expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence revolution.

>“Investors typically seek high quality stocks with strong balance sheets and strong cash flows during market turmoil,” said Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth. “The mega techs have become part of that defensive play recently.”

>That’s the hope many equity investors are hanging on, that mega-cap tech companies’ sway over the broader market and their relative security will limit any weakness in the stock market. The Magnificent Seven have a more than 30% weighting in the S&P 500.

"Contrarian alert: Uber’s missing the AI wave, yet it looks promising.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hy9eie/contrarian_alert_ubers_missing_the_ai_wave_yet_it/,"So, after Travis Kalanick got ousted, Dara Khosrowshahi stepped in and turned Uber from a “wartime” to a “peacetime” company. He cleaned up the culture mess, shoved aside long-term moonshots (like Uber’s self-driving unit) and put the company on a strict path to profitability (as expected from a former Wall Street banker).

Despite getting smacked by COVID and high interest rates, Uber tightened its belt, doubled down on demand-supply matchmaking, and came out profitable. Wall Street went nuts. Uber is now FCF-positive and aiming for even higher margins. 

**So what is Uber today?**

Dara says they’re laser-focused on nailing that perfect supply-demand match. Sure, they’re winning in mobility and they might tackle new verticals like Fiverr-style marketplaces. Sounds great, except they’re missing out on the biggest opportunity of our era, which is motherfucking **AI.**

Uber collects **11B trips** a year from **160M users**, racking up insane amounts of data (driver reviews, food reviews, social patterns across countless cities etc). This could’ve made them a self-driving powerhouse. But they ditched their autonomous unit in 2020 to cut costs, just as NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang now shows off new automotive processors and partnerships with Toyota, Aurora (who bought Uber’s AV unit), and Volvo. **Uber’s name is nowhere on that list!!!**

No matter how you spin it, a simple “supply-demand” marketplace could get overshadowed once autonomous vehicles go mainstream. Especially when you already own the infrastructure for ride-hailing, food delivery, scooters and bikes.

**Investors might be licking their chops (at least I would do it If I were them)** at two big plays:

1. **Pull a Reddit:** Sell anonymized data for LLM training and get lots of money, further increasing margins. Instantly, Uber gets an “AI play.” 
2. **Sell to Tesla or Google:** Supercharge someone else’s AV ambitions (as well as their foundation models) and get a fat premium in the process.

Meanwhile, the stock still looks undervalued. Uber’s **LTM P/FCF** is around **22.6x**, PEG is **under 1.0x** (Peter Lynch territory), and a Reverse DCF suggests they only need **9.2% revenue growth** (at \~12.4% margins) over 10 years to justify the current price. That’s totally doable.

Here’s how I see it playing out:

1. **Best case:** Tesla or Google acquires them this year and we get a solid premium payday. Probably a stock deal, but it’s still peanuts compared to Tesla and Google market caps. 
2. **Second best:** Uber pivots to selling AI training data. 
3. **Not bad either:** Uber dominates more human-driven marketplaces. 
4. **Base scenario:** They stick to mobility, keep expanding margins, and *maybe* bolt on third-party AVs .

Despite the focus on the company’s AI data center products the past year, the chip maker is still releasing its latest processor technologies to boost the PC gaming experiences for consumers.

On Monday, Nvidia unveiled its next generation gaming graphic cards at the CES tech trade show in Las Vegas. The company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, announced the coming RTX 5090 card and three other models, all of which will use “Blackwell” architecture chips.

“Blackwell, the engine of AI, has arrived for PC gamers,” Huang said.

The RTX 5090 will sell for $1,999, while the 5080, 5070 Ti, and 5070 will cost $999, $749, and $549, respectively. The 5090 and 5080 will be available on Jan. 30, while the other cards will be available starting in February.

The RTX 50 Series cards will also support Nvidia’s fourth generation DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology, which boosts performance by rendering images at lower resolutions and then using artificial intelligence to reconstruct details at higher resolutions. A Nvidia executive says DLSS 4.0 uses the latest AI transformer models to improve image quality.

Nvidia says the RTX 5090 will outperform the prior generation’s RTX 4090 by up to two times when using DLSS 4.0.

Huang also announced an AI desktop computer named Project DIGITS, which runs a Linux-based operating system and incorporates a GB10 Blackwell Superchip that can deliver up to 1 petaflop of AI performance.

“Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI,” Huang said.

Project DIGITS will be available in May, starting at $3,000.

Taiwan's Foxconn (2317.TW), opens new tab, the world's largest contract electronics maker, beat expectations to post its highest-ever revenue for the fourth quarter on continued strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) servers.

Over half of Microsoft’s $80 billion in spending will take place in the U.S., Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith wrote. Microsoft’s 2025 fiscal year ends in June. 

“Today, the United States leads the global AI race thanks to the investment of private capital and innovations by American companies of all sizes, from dynamic start-ups to well-established enterprises,” Smith said. “At Microsoft, we’ve seen this firsthand through our partnership with OpenAI, from rising firms such as Anthropic and xAI, and our own AI-enabled software platforms and applications.”

Several top-tier technology companies are rushing to spend billions on Nvidia graphics processing units for training and running AI models. The fast spread of OpenAI’s ChatGPT assistant, which launched in late 2022, kicked off the AI race for companies to deliver their own generative AI capabilities.

Microsoft reported $20 billion in capital expenditures and assets acquired under finance leases worldwide, with $14.9 billion spent on property and equipment, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Capital expenditures will increase sequentially in the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in October.

The top 5 performing stocks of the past decade have one thing in common,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hpq7fr/the_top_5_performing_stocks_of_the_past_decade/,"The five best performing stocks of the past decade Nvidia, AMD, Camtek, Fair Isaac, and Tesla  have one thing in common: their stock prices have all experienced at least one drop of 50% or more. For example, Tesla's stock dropped by more than 70%, and Nvidia experienced a 66% decline in 2022. These sharp fluctuations caused many investors to panic and sell. However, if we had sold during these major drops, we would have missed out on the subsequent huge gains



These stocks have had compound annual growth rates ranging from 40% to 75% For instance, if you had invested $10,000 in Tesla ten years ago, it would now be worth $290,000, and Nvidia return is even more impressive, with a $10,000 investment now worth nearly $2.7 million



This made me realize that an important investment principle is to ""let your winners keep winning"" While there are only a few winners in the market, if we can hold on to them in our portfolio, the returns can be very significant. However, to do this, investors need to overcome the fear of large price fluctuations and avoid selling when prices drop 

It is often only after such fluctuations that these stocks experience the next big rise



Investment guru Charlie Munger once said, ""If you can't calmly endure a 50% drop in stock prices two or three times, you're not suited to be a common shareholder"" I have come to understand that market volatility is inevitable, and investors must learn to accept significant price swings and remain calm during downturns The key is to have a clear investment thesis when buying stocks, understand the company's long term value, and compare the company’s performance to your judgment. If things are progressing as expected, holding on is usually a good idea, because it gives you confidence during market turbulence



In summary, one of the most important investment principles is to continue holding on to the stocks that are performing well, even if they experience significant volatility. Volatility is part of the market, and only by having strong conviction can we maintain long-term returns through market turbulence",2024-12-30 15:54:41,428,159,stocks

Why SoundHound AI Will Hit $30 ,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hik9th/why_soundhound_ai_will_hit_30/,"1. Addressing Concerns Right Away

Yes, the Price-to-Sales ratio is high, and technicals show it’s “overbought,” but remember, this is typical for early-stage AI companies with hyper-growth potential. The Fed’s recent rate cut to 4.25%-4.5% reduces borrowing costs, which can benefit growth stocks by improving future cash flow valuations. SoundHound AI isn’t “overvalued”—it’s priced for the massive upside AI offers.

2. Strategic Partnerships Are Game-Changers

SoundHound AI has locked in deals with major players like Hyundai, Snapdragon, and Qualcomm. These aren’t just one-off partnerships—they’re long-term collaborations that embed SoundHound AI’s voice AI into global products. Partnerships like these aren’t easy to replicate and build a moat for SoundHound AI.

3. Niche Advantage in Voice AI

Unlike broader AI plays like Palantir or Nvidia, SoundHound AI has carved out a specific niche in voice and conversational AI, which is projected to grow 25% annually. They dominate in this field, creating tools for industries like automotive, hospitality, and IoT. Voice AI is becoming a key differentiator for companies—and SoundHound AI is leading the charge.

4. Institutional Interest Is Growing

Institutional ownership is starting to rise, which is a great sign of confidence from “smart money.” Funds and institutions often wait for proof of execution before jumping in, and SoundHound AI’s recent growth metrics (40% YoY revenue) are drawing their attention. This could lead to a snowball effect of increased demand and higher prices. BlackRock, Vanguard, and NVIDIA hold significant ownership, so the volatility is a little overstated. 

TL;DR

Concerns about valuation and technicals are common for high-growth stocks, but SoundHound AI’s partnerships, niche focus, and growing institutional interest make it a strong buy in the AI space. Combine that with the tailwind of rate cuts, and $30 seems within reach.

Not financial advice, but I’m holding and optimistic. ",2024-12-20 13:55:06,0,19,stocks
Intel currently represents one of the best stock opportunities for 2025,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hhi6lc/intel_currently_represents_one_of_the_best_stock/,"Disclaimer: I am not a bagholder. I recently entered a position with a big part of my portfolio. I like to look at stocks where I think the market is mispricing risks and opportunities. I called for buying Alphabet in this sub in September and see a similar opportunity here (although not quite as strong).

1. Intel is currently trading at 10-20% below its own book value. This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19.

2. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price.

3. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support.

4. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD.

5. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died.

6. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here.

7. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over.

8. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning. Other tech companies will follow with their designs.",2024-12-19 02:06:46,293,286,stocks

From GPU to ASIC: Broadcom to capture NVDA  market share!,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hfldj9/from_gpu_to_asic_broadcom_to_capture_nvda_market/,"Broadcom Surge Highlights the Importance of AI

Let’s start with some expert opinions I read over the weekend about Broadcom’s impressive rally views I completely agree with

At the hardware level, training costs are skyrocketing, limiting participation to a few CSP (cloud service providers) that can afford it.     As economies of scale see diminishing returns, these companies are shifting their strategies toward customer acquisition, commercialization, and retention—similar to Microsoft’s current approach.     With growing focus on model deployment and revenue generation, inference is bound to take center stage.     Open source models are becoming more valuable, enabling AI application developers to focus on building apps rather than training models from scratch.     It’s akin to the role Linux played during the cloud operating system boom.

The traditional scaling laws based on data are nearing a bottleneck.     We’re likely approaching the end of the pretraining era, with the future pointing towards the ""Agent and Reason"" age.

Here’s the key takeaway: Broadcom predicts that by 2027, its three largest existing clients (likely ByteDance, Google, and Meta) will deploy over one million arithmetic card units.     Additionally, two more clients are undergoing validation, potentially driving $60–90 billion in AI-related revenue.    That said, expectations for overall AI capital expenditure changes remain modest.

This shift represents more of a structural change in existing capital allocation.   NVIDIA, which currently dominates with over 75% of the arithmetic card market, may see its lead challenged.     Broadcom’s ASIC solutions and NVIDIA’s GPUs could eventually share the market.    Once AI models stabilize, ASIC—being application-specific—could offer a significant cost advantage over general purpose GPU.

For major cloud providers, the massive capital expenditures have sparked criticism from shareholders.     At this point, these companies must demonstrate revenue growth to justify the spending.

As I write this, AVGO  is soaring again.     Broadcom rise was anticipated, but the market sentiment is electrifying.     Investors are desperately hunting for the next NVDA.     After cashing out Tesla last week, I thought Monday might bring a big move for Tesla.     Instead, Broadcom stole the spotlight.     While Tesla did rise, it couldn’t match Broadcom momentum.

No need to fear heights—Broadcom rally has just begun.",2024-12-16 15:18:27,25,41,stocks

Nvidia slip as China opens investigates possible antimonopoly law violation,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ha938m/nvidia_slip_as_china_opens_investigates_possible/,"Nvidia shares were under pressure Monday after a Chinese regulator said it was investigating the chipmaker over possible violations to the country’s antimonopoly law.

Shares slipped about 2% before the bell.

The State Administration for Market Regulation opened an investigation into the chipmaker in relation to acquisition of Mellanox, the Chinese government said Monday.

“In recent days, due to Nvidia’s suspected violation of China’s anti-monopoly law and the State Administration for Market Regulation’s restrictive conditions around Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox shares ... the State Administration for Market Regulation is opening a probe into Nvidia in accordance with law,” according to a statement translated by CNBC.

Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The news comes as competition heats up between the U.S. and China over chipmaking capabilities, with the Biden administration last week announcing a final slew of curbs targeting semiconductor toolmakers.

The U.S. has amped up restrictions on chip sales to the second-largest economy in recent years, barring Nvidia and other key semiconductors from selling their most advanced AI chips in an effort to limit the country from strengthening its military. The company has worked to create new products to sell in China that abide by the U.S. regulations.

Shares of the AI chip darling have outperformed this year, rallying nearly 188% as investors ramp up bets on the sector more than two years after ChatGPT’s initial debut. Shares have also helped push the market the market to new highs, along with the broader technology sector.

Why I'm bullish on Intel (INTC),https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h9zs68/why_im_bullish_on_intel_intc/,"I know after recent CEO firings, sentiment is low right now. But usually the best bargains are when investors are fearful. Not financial advice.

Intel has been one of the worst performing stocks in the last several years. They just got rid of a CEO, their foundries have not been up to the task, they are severely behind Nvidia and AMD in AI sector with GPUs, they have reported poor earnings, and their consumer CPUs and wafers have been getting railroaded by AMD and TSMC. 

However, I believe now is the best time to invest. 

I believe things are finally starting to turn ship for Intel. For example - 

* Their 18As have been getting decent yields despite the biased reporting, and look promising. Sure, TSMC is still their biggest rival and ahead of Intel, but Intel can catch up. If they can pluck a few talents from TSMC, or invest greater in their R&D, with US govt chip money backing them, it's possible.
* US government has a vested interest is not letting Intel to fail - it's a geopolitical issue to have cutting edge processor technology in US. If US continues to pump money into Intel just like Taiwan has done for TSMC, Intel can afford to expand its foundries and research cutting edge tech.
* Intel's new Battlemage GPUs seem really cost efficient and there is strong positive sentiment. They will start to gobble up more marketshare and absorb more of Nvidia's AI market as Intel's technology grows in the next gen. This is huge. Nvidia's marketcap is so big that if Intel even eats a bit of the AI market, it will grow exponentially. 
   * Intel's GPU technology looks already promising seeing how they are catching up in drivers and software, and their XeSS technology is ALREADY better than AMD's FSR. 
* They have been getting leaner with mass layoffs and shutting down European plants, and recently reported sell-to-lease transactions. They are cutting costs where they can. 
* Their recent mobile chips - Lunar Lake, have performed fantastic, with high performance and low wattage (which is critical for laptops that suffer under high heat).

TSMC in talks with Nvidia for AI chip production in Arizona,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h75r9y/tsmc_in_talks_with_nvidia_for_ai_chip_production/,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said.

TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.

Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.

The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.

TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.

Two of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.

All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.

Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gv9g66/qualcomm_says_it_expects_4_billion_in_pc_chip/,"Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gv6hj0/palantir_short_thesis_and_an_analysis_of_its/,"Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  
*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

Happy investing!",2024-11-19 20:04:07,87,68,stocks
Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gukbfk/super_micro_hires_new_auditor_to_maintain_nasdaq/,"Embattled server maker Super Micro Computer said on Monday that it’s hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.

“This is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement.

Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst & Young, stepped down in October. Ernst & Young was new to the job, having just replaced Deloitte & Touche as Super Micro’s accounting firm in March 2023.

Super Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange’s “review of the compliance plan.”

Shares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company’s market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.

Super Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.

On Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.

Super Micro was added to the S&P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.

The troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn’t file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.” The Wall Street Journal later reported that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.

The month after announcing its report delay, Super Micro said it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn’t in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq’s rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.

"New Nvidia AI chips overheating in servers, the Information reports",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtlzww/new_nvidia_ai_chips_overheating_in_servers_the/,"Nov 17 (Reuters) - Nvidia's new Blackwell AI Chips, which have already faced delays, have encountered problems with accompanying servers that overheat, causing some customers to worry they will not have enough time to get new data centers up and running, the Information reported on Sunday.The Blackwell graphics processing units overheat when connected together in server racks designed to hold up to 72 chips, the report said, citing sources familiar with the issue.

  
The chipmaker has asked its suppliers to change the design of the racks several times to resolve overheating problems, according to Nvidia employees who have been working on the issue, as well as customers and suppliers with knowledge of the issue, the report said without naming the suppliers.""Nvidia is working with leading cloud service providers as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.

  
In March, Nvidia unveiled Blackwell chips and had earlier said they would ship in the second quarter before encountering delays, potentially affecting customers such as Meta Platforms , Alphabet's Google and Microsoft .Nvidia's Blackwell chip takes two squares of silicon the size of the company's previous offering and binds them into a single component that is 30 times speedier at tasks like providing responses from chatbots.",2024-11-17 19:52:22,311,141,stocks
Naive question: Intel 18A--what could go wrong?,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1grrx4w/naive_question_intel_18awhat_could_go_wrong/,"\[Disclosure: not invested in Intel yet but thinking about doing so\]

Ok, we know Intel messed up and whatever but what I do not get (so please challenge my train of thoughts):

* Intel got newest machines from ASML last year
* They use them for 18A
* Like TSMC does for AMD, Apple, etc.
* Lunar Lake is a combo of Intel's design skills and TSMC's/ASML's fab skills
* But with low margins because of latter
* However, Lunar Lake turned out pretty good, so Intel's design skills are def there
* And with 18A, Intel will have everything in-house

So, what could go wrong? Maybe Intel need quite some time to catch up and have the same fab capacity based on ASML machines but we will get there at some point.

The competition? AMD will have (long-term!) lower margins b/c of TSMC (also slower time-to-market, lower quantities), Qualcomm has lower compat and needs still to resort issues with ARM, Nvidia while capable will need some time and will have a good offer but they won't have a fab either and will face compat issues like Qualcomm. Not saying that these are dealbreakers but yeah...

What does speak against Intel: org is too messed to get it ever restructured and/or reorg too expensive, running out of money (but gov money), time, building fabs needs years, zero EUV experience, low yields for years

Edit: Intel has a lower market cap than AMD despite AMD just having design in-house, they have more assets in the GPU department but it is insignificant compared to something like Nvidia and if we talk about IGPUs Intel seem to be on par

Edit2: Would at least a new CEO just give us a bump, so we could leave again with some short-term gains?

Edit3: typos

So, is buying Intel really a risk with its dirt-cheap pricing right now? Is it really ""dirt-cheap""?",2024-11-15 08:32:29,11,51,stocks

"AMD to lay off 4% of workforce, or about 1,000 employees",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqonzv/amd_to_lay_off_4_of_workforce_or_about_1000/,"AMD said on Wednesday that it will lay off 4% of its global staff as the longtime computer chipmaker seeks to gain a stronger foothold in the growing artificial intelligence chip space dominated by Nvidia.

*″*As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” an AMD representative said in a statement. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.”

AMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

AMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

AMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.

GPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

AMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.

PG&E to deploy nuclear-specific AI at Diablo Canyon plant ,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqokli/pge_to_deploy_nuclearspecific_ai_at_diablo_canyon/,"Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is deploying Atomic Canyon’s artificial intelligence-powered solutions for the nuclear energy sector at PG&E’s Diablo Canyon Power Plant, marking the inaugural commercial installation of the first on-site generative AI deployment at a U.S. generating facility.

Atomic Canyon’s Neutron Enterprise generative AI solution, built and running on NVIDIA’s full-stack AI platform, is being deployed at Diablo Canyon for document search and retrieval processes. PG&E also says the AI technology will deliver cost savings and improved operational efficiency.

Federal and state regulations require utilities that operate nuclear power plants to manage “billions of pages” of technical documentation, PG&E said, which are spread across multiple systems. Power plant personnel must spend both time and resources to retrieve this essential data – something PG&E argues the AI will help avoid. Neutron Enterprise is meant to integrate with Diablo Canyon’s systems, using the latest optical character recognition (OCR), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and AI-powered search technology meant to cut search times from hours to seconds.

“As the first nuclear power plant to implement Neutron Enterprise using the NVIDIA platform, we’re proud to lead the way in bringing cutting-edge innovation to our operations,” said Maureen Zawalick, vice president of business and technical services at Diablo Canyon Power Plant. “Atomic Canyon’s AI solutions will enable faster data retrieval, boosting collaboration and ensuring continued safe, but more efficient operations. Accessing critical information in seconds will let us focus on what truly matters—delivering reliable clean energy safely and affordably.”

The Neutron Enterprise solution is powered by Atomic Canyon’s FERMI family of AI models, developed in collaboration with the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and specifically designed for the nuclear energy sector.

As California’s only remaining nuclear power plant, Diablo Canyon provides nearly 9% of the state’s electricity and generates 17% of its zero-carbon energy. The California Energy Commission estimates that power demand across the state will rise roughly 43% in the next 15 years, which PG&E argues will make Diablo Canyon a more critical clean energy asset.

Reuters Exclusive: US ordered TSMC to halt shipments to China of chips used in AI applications,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gnos5a/reuters_exclusive_us_ordered_tsmc_to_halt/,"https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-ordered-tsmc-halt-shipments-china-chips-used-ai-applications-source-says-2024-11-10/

NEW YORK/SINGAPORE, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. ordered Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), to halt shipments of advanced chips to Chinese customers that are often used in artificial intelligence applications starting Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Department of Commerce sent a letter to TSMC imposing export restrictions on certain sophisticated chips, of 7 nanometer or more advanced designs, destined for China that power AI accelerator and graphics processing units (GPU), the person said.

The U.S. order, which is being reported for the first time, comes just weeks after TSMC notified the Commerce Department that one of its chips had been found in a Huawei AI processor, as Reuters reported last month. Tech research firm Tech Insights had taken apart the product, revealing the TSMC chip and apparent violation of export controls.

Huawei, at the center of the U.S. action, is on a restricted trade list, which requires suppliers to obtain licenses to ship any goods or technology to the company. Any license that could aid Huawei's AI efforts would likely be denied.

TSMC suspended shipments to China-based chip designer Sophgo after its chip matched the one found on the Huawei AI processor, sources told Reuters last month.

Reuters could not determine how the chip ended up on Huawei's Ascend 910B, released in 2022, viewed as the most advanced AI chip available from a Chinese company.

The latest clampdown hits many more companies and will allow the U.S. to assess whether other companies are diverting chips to Huawei for its AI processor.

As a result of the letter, TSMC notified affected clients that it was suspending shipments of chips starting Monday, the person said.
The Commerce Department declined comment.

A spokesperson for TSMC also declined to comment beyond saying it was a ""law-abiding company...committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.""

The Commerce Department communication -- known as an ""is informed"" letter -- allows the U.S. to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to quickly impose new licensing requirements on specific companies.

Ijiwei, a Chinese media site covering the semiconductor industry, reported on Friday that TSMC notified Chinese chip design companies it would suspend 7 nanometer or below chips for AI and GPU customers beginning Nov. 11.

The action comes as both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the inadequacy of export controls on China and the Commerce Department's enforcement of them.

In 2022, the Commerce Department sent is-informed letters to Nvidia and AMD restricting their ability to export top AI-related chips to China, and to chip equipment makers like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA to restrict tools to make advanced chips to China.

The restrictions in those letters were later turned into rules that apply to companies beyond them.

The U.S. has been delayed in updating rules on tech exports to China. As Reuters reported in July, the Biden administration drafted new rules on some foreign exports of chipmaking equipment and planned to add about 120 Chinese companies to the Commerce Department's restricted entity list, including chipmaking factories, toolmakers, and related companies.

But despite plans for an August release, and later tentative target dates for publication, the rules still have not been issued.",2024-11-10 00:57:47,477,142,stocks

Qualcomm pops on chipmaker's earnings and revenue beat,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1glceac/qualcomm_pops_on_chipmakers_earnings_and_revenue/,"Qualcomm reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, and the company guided to a strong December quarter.

The shares rose 10% in extended trading at one point before falling to a gain of about 4%.

Here’s how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ending Sept. 29:

Earnings per share: $2.69, adjusted $2.56 expected

Revenue: $10.24 billion versus $9.90 billion expected

Qualcomm said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, with the midpoint of that range beating LSEG consensus expectations of $10.59 billion.

The company reported $2.92 billion in net income, or $2.59 per share, a sharp jump from last year’s $1.49 billion, or $1.23 per share. Qualcomm reported $33.19 billion in total revenue in its fiscal 2024, a 9% increase from 2023.

Qualcomm’s fortunes have historically been tied to the smartphone industry, where the company provides a range of chips to handset makers, including system-on-a-chip processors, modems, and antennas. The company makes the chip at the heart of most high-end Android devices, and many lower-end phones as well. Qualcomm also sells modems and related chips to Apple for its iPhones, and last year said its contract for 5G chips ran through 2026.

Qualcomm reported a 12% increase in handset chip sales to $6.1 billion, in line with FactSet estimates. Qualcomm introduced its high-end chip for 2025, called Snapdragon 8 Elite, in October.

“In handsets we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues,” said Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala on a call with analysts.

Under CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has diversified away from being a smartphone supplier and has introduced and invested heavily in producing chips for PCs, cars, and industrial machines.

“We will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on the earnings call with analysts.

Qualcomm has also made efforts to brand itself as a leader in AI, having developed smartphone chips with specialized parts for machine learning since 2017. But unlike Nvidia, the company doesn’t produce the kind of graphics processors for data centers that are used for big AI programs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The automotive business grew 86% on an annual basis to $899 million in sales. Qualcomm says it has billions of dollars in business with automakers currently in its development pipeline, and highlighted it was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Qualcomm said that it expected automotive sales in the current quarter to rise 50% on an annual basis.

The company’s “internet of things” business includes both chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Meta uses in its Quest handsets and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. It also includes the new business selling chips for laptops running Microsoft Windows. The division reported $1.68 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from a year earlier.

Qualcomm’s chip business, including its handset, automotive, and other chips, which together is reported as QCT, saw sales rise 18% during the quarter to $7.37 billion in total. 

The company’s profitable technology licensing business, QTL, reported $1.52 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the same period last year.

Qualcomm said its board had approved $15 billion in additional buybacks. During the fourth quarter, it repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares and paid out $947 million in dividends.

Will Nvidia suffer due to increased tensions with China?,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gl3byx/will_nvidia_suffer_due_to_increased_tensions_with/,"I want to be clear this is not a political post. Not looking for political opinions.

  
Post-January, we're likely to be entering a period of increased tensions with China. This seems bad for Nvidia in multiple ways.

1. Beijing has previously expressed desire to urgently switch away from NVDA chips and invest locally. Obviously that's easier said than done, but with China being such a huge market for NVDA, increased tensions over tariffs could push this mandate further. The amount of revenue NVDA gets from China has already decreased, but this further deceleration could be negative. [https://archive.is/v40zX](https://archive.is/v40zX)

  
2. Trump has accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry. He wants to put tariffs on chips from Taiwan. Obviously, everyone is relying on TSMC, so this seems clearly bad news.

Super Micro Computer- SMCI $26 - Avoid Till We Get Restated Financials,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gkgqx3/super_micro_computer_smci_26_avoid_till_we_get/,"**I think Super Micro Computer, (SMCI) should be avoided for the following reasons:**

**Restatements could alter the financials significantly:** The odds are high that the company will end up restating past financials. The Auditor’s resignation, its CEO’s pay package, and its past settlement with the SEC in 2018 all suggest that SMCI will have to restate its financial statements.

**No 10K:** SMCI has delayed its annual 10-K filing and without an audited 10K, we have precious little faith in the numbers. 

**SMCI has priors:** This was not their first time. In 2018, the company settled charges with the [SEC for improper accounting](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190). As stated in the article from the SEC website….

>

**Tainted:** To me the alleged malfeasance creates significant doubts for investors that will not go away for a while, and it's very likely that Wall Street will not touch it, fearing liability for not doing enough due diligence. Also, I can’t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.

**Possible Loan Default:**  There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America. 

**Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO’s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.

**Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.

**A great business:** Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.

**Ignore the low valuation:** I’m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different

The only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.

The other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books. Instead of focusing on the fundamentals, we’ll be spending far too much time, and worse without success trying to figure out what is genuine or not, It would make better sense to invest in other GPU/semiconductor businesses.

Nvidia Overtakes Apple to Become World's Largest Company,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gjgfct/nvidia_overtakes_apple_to_become_worlds_largest/,"
Nvidia stock was rising early Monday, pushing its market capitalization past Apple's to make the chip maker the world's largest company.

Nvidia shares were up 1.4% at $137.35 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Friday.

That gave Nvidia a market cap of $3.365 trillion, just ahead of Apple's $3.338 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Continued high spending from big technology companies on artificial-intelligence infrastructure, including the company's Blackwell processors, look to be a more fundamental driver for Nvidia stock.

""We have further raised our big tech capex forecasts following the quarterly results last week. We now expect their combined spending to grow 50% this year to $222 billion, and another 20% to $267 billion in 2025,"" wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a research note.

"Nvidia to join Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ghghq5/nvidia_to_join_dow_jones_industrial_average/,"Nvidia is replacing Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a shakeup to the blue-chip index that replaces a flagging semiconductor company with the primary vendor of GPUs for AI.

The switch will take place on Nov. 8. In a separate move, Sherwin Williams will replace Dow Inc in the average as well, S&P Global said in a statement.

Shares of Nvidia have climbed over 180% so far in 2024 as investors have seen the company as the primary beneficiary of the AI boom.

On the other hand, Intel shares have fallen 51% so far this year as the company struggles with manufacturing, new competition for its central processors, and the impression that it has missed out on the AI trend.

The Dow contains 30 components and is weighted by the share price of the individual stocks instead of the companies total market value.

BlackRock launches ETF that expands beyond the ‘Magnificent Seven’,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gh4zwd/blackrock_launches_etf_that_expands_beyond_the/,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/megacap-tech-gets-new-blackrock-etf.html


> BlackRock’s iShares is trying to appeal to investors who want to diversify beyond from the so-called Magnificent Seven. The firm launched the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT) this month. It doesn’t just hold the Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. It’s made up of the 20 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization. “What the iShares build ETFs are designed to do is to deliver a tool kit of simple solutions for investors to be able to capture the growth of some of the largest companies within the U.S. equity market today, but to do so in a broader and more diversified manner,” BlackRock’s Rachel Aguirre told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” on Monday.

> Aguirre, the firm’s head of U.S. iShares product, noted the ETF’s mission is to deliver an easy and accessible way to tap into the innovation of megacaps – “whether that be in the tech-heavy Nasdaq space or, more broadly, within the S&P [500].” The ETF, according to Aguirre, provides a way for investors worried about the concentration of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the S&P 500.

> On Thursday, the Magnificent Seven slid more than 3.5% as a group — losing around $615 billion in market cap. That’s equivalent to the size of JPMorgan Chase. However, the Magnificent Seven is still up about 43% so far year while the S&P 500 is up around 20% “It’s important for clients and investors to remember that there are split views on this topic. There are many investors who believe that the big will get bigger [and] that the winners will continue to win,” Aguirre said. “There’s also another side to this argument. There are many investors who believe that it’s actually a very worrisome time to continue investing in… mega-cap companies because of just their high valuations.”",2024-11-01 13:09:52,149,63,stocks
DeepSeek Hasn’t Deep-Sixed Nvidia,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1idy85s/deepseek_hasnt_deepsixed_nvidia/,"**Here is my understanding of the DeepSeek breakthrough and its repercussions on the AI ecosystem**

DeepSeek used “Time scaling” effectively, which allows their r1 model to think deeper at the inference phase. By using more power instead of coming up with the answer immediately, the model will take longer to research for a better solution and then answer the question better than existing models.

**How did the model get to that level of efficiency?**

DeepSeek used a lot of interesting and effective techniques to make better use of its resources, and [this article from NextPlatform ](https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/01/27/how-did-deepseek-train-its-ai-model-on-a-lot-less-and-crippled-hardware/)does an excellent job with the details.

Besides effective time scaling the model distilled the answers from other models including ChatGPT’s models.

**What does that mean for the future of AGI, AI, ASI, and so on?**

Time scaling will be adopted more frequently, and tech leaders across Silicon Valley are responding to improve their methods - not like they have a choice. Databricks' CEO's phone hasn't stopped ringing, and Microsoft is already offering r1 as part of Azure. That is the logical and sequential next step – for AI to be any good, it was always superior inference that was going to be the differentiator and value addition.

Time scaling can be done at the edge as the software gets smarter.

However, more difficult solutions such as drug discovery will naturally require greater resources and the cloud.

**If the software gets smarter, will it require more GPUs?**

I believe GPU requirements will not diminish because you need GPUs for training and time scaling, smarter software will still need to distill data that has been trained. Nvidia's Blackwells are also touting 40% Total Cost Reductions for that much power, they are aiming for efficiency and better cost.

Cheaper LLMs are not a plug-and-play replacement. They will still require significant investments and expertise to train and create an effective inference model. Just as a number aiming at a 10x reduction in cost is a good target, but it will likely compromise quality and performance. Eventually, the lower-tier market will get crowded and commoditized – democratized if you will, which may require cheaper versions of hardware and architecture from AI chip designers, as an opportunity to serve lower-tier customers.

**Inferencing**

Over time, yes inference will become more important – Nvidia has been talking about the scaling law, which diminishes the role of training and the need to get smarter inference for a long time. They are working on this as well, I even suspect that the $3,000 Digits they showcased for edge computing will provide some of the power needed.

**Reducing variable costs per token/query is huge:** The variable cost will reduce, which is a huge boon to the AI industry, previously retrieving and answering tokens cost more than the entire monthly subscription to ChatGPT or Gemini.

**From Gavin Baker on X on APIs and Costs: (emphasis mine)**

>

**On training costs and real costs:**

>

**The NextPlatform too expressed doubts about DeepSeek’s resources**

>

A schedule of geographical revenues for Nvidia’s Q3-FY2025 showed over $4Bn revenue “sold” to Singapore, with the caveat that it may not be the ultimate destination, which also creates doubts that DeepSeek may have gotten access to Nvidia’s higher-end GPUs despite the US export ban or stockpiled them before the ban. 

**Better software and inference is the way of the future**

As one of the AI vendors at CES told me, she had the algorithms to answer customer questions and provide analytical insides at the edge for several customers – they have the data from their customers and the software, but they couldn’t scale because AWS was charging them too much for cloud GPU usage when they didn’t need that much power. So besides r1’s breakthrough in AGI, this movement has been afoot for a while, and this will spur investment and innovation in inference. 

However I strongly believe that there is still a humongous amount of training still to be done for high-quality AI, and that will remain an ongoing process.

We will continue to see demand for high-end Blackwell GPUs to train data and create better models for at least the next 18 months to 24 months after which the focus could shift to inference and as Nvidia’s CEO said, 40% of their GPUs are already being used for inference.",2025-01-30 21:35:30,0,7,investing
Micron's Low Price Is A Gift,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1idxk34/microns_low_price_is_a_gift/,"Micron’s data center revenue (based on consensus analysts' forecasts) should grow 91% and 38% in FY2025 and FY2026, driven by cloud server DRAM and HBM.

The market is not assigning a strong multiple to Micron’s largest, most profitable, and fastest-growing segment, with HBM3E contributing significantly, and future growth expected from HBM4.

Micron should gain from a robust AI market. Huge CAPEX from hyperscalers, Nvidia’s Blackwell growth, and Taiwan Semiconductors’ high growth revenue forecasts bode well for Micron.

Micron has cyclical weaknesses - The consumer NAND business faced challenges due to inventory reductions, seasonal slowdowns, and delayed PC refresh cycles, which impacted Q2 revenue guidance and margins.

Despite these weaknesses and challenges of NAND not finding a cyclical bottom and continued pricing pressure, Micron’s strong data center prospects, and attractive valuation make it a buy, especially at the current price of $90-$95.

Micron dropped after DeepSeek deep-sixed the entire AI/GPU hyperscaler spending argument, but I feel the sell-off is overdone. I added shares this morning.",2025-01-30 21:07:18,31,13,investing
What is going on with China's recent developments in quantum computing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1idvca4/what_is_going_on_with_chinas_recent_developments/,"Google [Tianyan-504](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google it, right now. Who’s reporting this? China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the markets don't seem to have a clue.

TL;DR: Simply put, I believe the markets have not reacted to China’s most recent advancements in quantum computing. China is potentially not as far behind the USA as markets would have you believe. I provide here a commentary of recent market movements, in relation to recent quantum computing news and developments. I follow with a more technical discussion of the significance of China’s advancements, those of US corporations.

Financial disclaimer: While I justify my comments where possible, some of the comments I make in this post are pure speculation. I do not recommend making speculative trades, such as shorting quantum computing, or buying quantum cybersecurity. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.

  
I was astounded to see the latest news dominating the headlines. How did the market not know that China was developing its own language-learning models? I’m a filthy casual, and even I knew about it. It’s been in our news at least [since July](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/20/deepseek-v2-0628-released-an-improved-open-source-version-of-deepseek-v2/), and available for use [since September last year](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news0905). It was pretty fucking good back then, too. And there’s Alibaba’s Qwenchat, Tencent’s HunYuan, among numerous others they haven’t even started talking about yet. What else have they forgotten, in this wild speculative bull run? They probably think the USA is lightyears ahead in quantum computing too. Oh, oh. They do, don't they?

Before you go any further, look up [Tianyan-504](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml). Look up [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11924). Google them, right now. They’re right there, massive Chinese developments both announced in December 2024. Reportedly, the Tianyan-504 surpasses 500 qubits, on par with IBM’s latest developments. And reportedly, Zuchongzhi 3.0 breaks Google’s earlier Sycamore by all key metrics. Why can’t we find any article produced by any reputable financial sources, that discuss the significance of these achievements? There is essentially zero market news about it. China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the market has no fucking clue.

I cannot share images on r/investing. You can refer to my profile for further analysis of specific stocks.

Check out D-Wave stock prices, for example. Given a large part of their business model relies in part on how they contribute to research in the field, they should be negatively impacted by major research developments in competing economies. Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied quantum computing stocks and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down. However, their stock prices did not move on 6/12 and 16/12 (corresponding with news releases of China's developments), suggesting that China’s developments have had no impact.

How about Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT)? It tells a similar story. Their focus is on fabrication of photonic quantum computing components – and again, providing researchers access to quantum computing technology. It looks like Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied stocks, and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down. Again, China’s developments have had zero impact.

How about IBM? News about Google’s Willow pushed their price down some 3%, which makes good sense. Willow’s performace blew that of IBM’s September R2 Heron processor out of the water. Willow is a competitor, but IBM’s position in the market means they are diversified in so much more than just quantum computing. A small bearish reaction makes perfect sense. So when Tianyan-504 reportedly challenged IBM's benchmarks just three days before Willow did, why didn’t the stock price move?

You can look at SkyWater Technologies (SKYT), and at Global Foundries (GFS), and Rigetti (RGTI), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), TSM (TSM), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Every one of these key companies relevant to advancing quantum computing in the Western World have one thing in common. When China announces their developments, the markets appear to stay still.

There are three possible reasons for this that I have come up with. There may be other reasons as well that I am not aware of, in which case I encourage you to enlighten me.

The first possible reason is as above: The market is generally not aware. It is likely that some players in the market are aware, and this is a simple piece of information that such players will be taking advantage of – they do not have incentive to highlight this knowledge. Furthermore, the market may be uniquely slow to react. Unlike DeepSeek, which we can physically interact with, breaking records in quantum computing research is less tangible, less sensational. Breaking news, markets are irrational.

The second possible reason is simple: China may be lying. I can not find any evidence to support this idea, and China’s past claims about quantum computing, such as those about [Jiuzhang](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), have been demonstrably true.

The third possible reason is that China’s quantum computers are not as technically advanced as they sound. Originally I wanted to follow with a full technical discussion about the recent history of Chinese Quantum computing, and the merits of Tianyan-504 and Zuchongzhi 3.0 in comparison to western quantum computing efforts. But since I am not a subject matter expert, and I do not have the time to write in full depth. But I will provide a bit more technical information, summarise and provide references to the academic research for relevant breakthrough technologies, so you can read for yourself.

China is fighting to lead the global race in quantum computing, and [the Chinese government has been investing tens of billions of dollars into quantum computing research](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/04/13/chinese-quantum-companies-and-national-strategy-2023/), alongside the investments of Chinese institutions and corporations.

In 2020 [Jiuzhang, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), was the second quantum computer in the world to achieve quantum supremacy](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), and the first photonic quantum computer to do so. Since then, the university has gone on to create further models of Jiuzhang, and develop chips with greater qubit lifetime and fidelity.

In April 2024, The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics developed their [Xiaohong superconducting chip](https://english.news.cn/20240425/a95b3c190a59486886f4cddc0def31cd/c.html), their most advanced to date, anticipated to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM’s Heron in key performance metrics including qubit lifetime (how long a qubit can hold its quantum state) and readout fidelity (accuracy in extracting information from qubits). I note the market did not appear to react to the Xiaohong chip either.

On the 13^(th) of November 2024,[ IBM announced their Quantum Heron R2](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), achieving their goal of running quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gates, demonstrating advancements in in qubit lifetime and readout fidelity.

On the 6^(th) of December 2024, [Tianyan-504 was announced](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml), developed by China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., and, built on the Xiaohong chips. China is now the only country to achieve quantum computational advantage through both photonics and superconducting quantum computing technologies. This quantum computer will be incorporated into their quantum computing cloud platform, and made available for researcher purposes.

On the 9^(th) of December, [Google’s Willow was announced](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/). What makes Willow exceptional, is that it provides a breakthrough solution to quantum computing’s fidelity issue. It exponentially reduces the amount of error while adding more qubits. Presumably Willow can now be scaled further, and I expect to see further developments with adding more qubits now that this challenge has been solved.

Two weeks later, on the 16^(th) of December 2024, an entirely separate research team with the China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. [announced their Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.11924v1#S1). This superconducting quantum computer makes numerous advancements, and demonstrates quantum advantage through speed. It crushes benchmarks set by Google’s older Sycamore - “Compared to Google’s latest experiment, SYC-67 and SYC-70  the classical simulation cost of our 83-qubit, 32-cycle experiment is six orders of magnitude higher.” Though Zuchongzhi 3.0 does not demonstrate the error correction capability that Willow does, their creators have commented that they believe they can replicate the same techniques in a matter of months.

Quantum computing is still twenty years away from being relevant, they say. That gives lots of time for China to catch up. And from what I can understand, China is just one breakthrough away. There are other questions, such as China’s chip manufacturing capabilities, supply chains for components, that I am unable to find good information on. The US is doing what they can politically, through trade regulation, and restricting financial investment in China’s technologies. China already has the [lead in quantum communications, and potentially in quantum sensing](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/). But China holds one massive advantage: it’s regime. In contrast to the American model, where corporations closely guard their own secrets from eachother, [China is claims they invest 15 billion of dollars into coordinated, cohesive research.](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/) And it is showing in their results.

Each advancement that China makes in developing its quantum computing capability, ought to remind the market that there is a risk that the lead the US enjoys in quantum computing is being threatened. But look at those google search results again. Outside of technical circles, the western media simply hasn't picked it up. Look at what happened with DeepSeek. I think the markets just don't know. Investors are already anxious about their investments in quantum computing, and are starting to demand returns. Manufacturers are reluctant to scale component production, given the low demand and potential for volatility. So when the market does find out about China’s achievements in quantum computing, what's going to happen?

Nvidia and the efficient market hypothesis,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ic8stl/nvidia_and_the_efficient_market_hypothesis/,"“in the short term, the market is a voting machine. In the long-term, it is a weighing machine”. - Benjamin Graham

A ""weighing machine"" represents the idea that in the long run, a company's stock price will accurately reflect its true fundamental value, based on factors like earnings and assets, while a ""voting machine"" signifies the short-term market fluctuations driven by investor sentiment and emotions, where prices can be volatile based on popular opinion rather than intrinsic worth; essentially, the market acts like a voting booth where investors ""vote"" on a stock price based on current sentiment, but eventually, the ""weighing machine"" of fundamentals takes over to determine the true value.


The market is full of irrational investors. That's why some investors can beat the market in the short term but only a very few beat the market for the long term.

NVDA: Buying the Dip Amid DeepSeek AI and the AI Race,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ibo397/nvda_buying_the_dip_amid_deepseek_ai_and_the_ai/,"

* **DeepSeek's Claims:** Released AI models (R1 and R1 Zero) claiming OpenAI-level performance with lower costs and less advanced chips, causing semiconductor stocks to drop.
* **Scalability Concerns:** Experts doubt whether DeepSeek’s approach can scale to meet the demands of growing AI adoption.
* **U.S. Export Ban:** Restrictions on advanced chip exports to China have spurred innovation but limit scaling and next-gen model development.
* **AI Adoption Still Early:** AI applications in industries like transportation, medicine, and home automation remain nascent, requiring advanced chips for growth.
* **Nvidia’s Strong Position:** Despite short-term stock dips, Nvidia’s dominance in GPUs and projected growth (EBITDA from $34.5B in 2024 to $166.8B in 2027) highlight its long-term potential.
* **Investment Case:** Continued demand for high-performance chips ensures Nvidia’s relevance in the expanding AI market.

Nvidia is currently navigating a challenging landscape as DeepSeek, a company specializing in AI models, has unveiled its DeepSeek R1 and R1 Zero models. These models claim to rival OpenAI's performance at significantly lower training costs, just $6 million, using less advanced chips. The announcement has sent shockwaves through the semiconductor industry, leading to declining stock prices for companies like Nvidia. DeepSeek's claims suggest a potential shift in AI development priorities, focusing on cost-efficiency rather than the procurement of high-end chips. However, experts remain skeptical about the scalability of this approach. As AI adoption grows, so will the need for advanced chips capable of handling increased query volumes and more complex use cases.

The U.S. export ban on high-end chips to China has added another layer of complexity to the situation. While the ban aims to limit China's access to advanced technology, it may have inadvertently spurred innovation, forcing companies like DeepSeek to achieve more with less. Despite this, scaling AI models and developing next-generation solutions still require significant computational power, which advanced chips uniquely provide. With each GPU generation, improvements in power efficiency and performance become essential for addressing growing demand, particularly as AI applications expand across industries like transportation, medicine, and home automation.

AI adoption is still in its infancy, with significant growth potential across various sectors. Autonomous vehicles, for instance, represent less than 0.002% of the global car fleet, highlighting the vast untapped opportunities for AI-driven technologies. Similarly, the use of AI in medical research, molecular science, and household appliances remains limited, indicating substantial room for expansion. As these applications evolve, they will require a robust supply of advanced chips to achieve cost-effective scalability and enhanced efficiency. Even with advancements in cost-efficient training methods, scaling AI adoption to meet global demand will depend on continued investment in high-performance chips.

Nvidia remains well-positioned to benefit from this dynamic. While its stock has faced short-term pressure, the company's dominance in the GPU market and its projected growth underscore its long-term potential. Analysts estimate Nvidia's EBITDA to grow from $34.5 billion in 2024 to $166.8 billion by 2027, with free cash flow rising at a similar pace. This growth justifies Nvidia's premium valuation and positions it as a critical player in the AI-driven future. The competition spurred by DeepSeek and similar initiatives ultimately reinforces the need for advanced chips, ensuring Nvidia's relevance and profitability in the evolving AI landscape.

**TL;DR:** Despite DeepSeek's claims of cost-effective AI model training with less advanced chips, Nvidia's leadership in the GPU market and the growing demand for advanced chips to scale AI applications make it a compelling long-term investment opportunity.",2025-01-27 23:54:54,0,5,investing
The Market Is Dropping After Huge AI Breakthrough—But Isn’t This Great News?,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ibl8xf/the_market_is_dropping_after_huge_ai/,"Today, news broke about a revolutionary AI model that’s open-source, extremely powerful, and developed with far fewer resources than ever before. This should be cause for celebration—it’s a major step forward for global productivity. Yet, the stock market is responding with a significant sell-off.

Tech-heavy companies like NVIDIA and TSMC are seeing double-digit drops (around 17%), and the broader tech sector is down \~5%. For those of us holding global index funds, this means a drop in value, as these companies carry significant weight. But here’s the puzzling part: shouldn’t this kind of breakthrough *increase* the long-term value of the total market?

Cheaper and more accessible AI means businesses across every sector can improve their efficiency, cut costs, and innovate faster. From logistics and manufacturing to healthcare and finance, the potential productivity boost is enormous. This isn’t bad news—it’s a massive opportunity for non-tech companies to thrive.

Yet, the market seems fixated on the short-term impact to companies that *develop* AI or produce the hardware for it. It’s as if the market is missing the forest for the trees. Why should the total value of all publicly traded companies *fall* on the news of a breakthrough that’s bound to make them more productive and profitable?

This feels like a moment where the market hasn’t fully priced in the reality of what this could mean. In the long run, wouldn’t a global index fund naturally benefit as this technology drives economic growth across industries?

So here’s my question to the community:

* Is the market too focused on the immediate losers (like NVIDIA or TSMC) while ignoring the broader winners?
* How can investors position themselves to reflect the long-term productivity gains from this development?
* Are there sectors, regions, or funds that might capture this shift better than a traditional global index fund?",2025-01-27 21:53:19,0,24,investing
I believe Nvidia's sell-off is justified—I think they have lost their MOAT.,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ibkwgf/i_believe_nvidias_selloff_is_justifiedi_think/,"A large part of Nvidia’s stock price is tied to the perception that their latest and greatest chips are the only way to achieve the best AI models. However, DeepSeek has proven that this is not the case—state-of-the-art models can be developed using older chips. Granted, they still used Nvidia chips, but this fundamentally shifts the equation.

This means Nvidia has lost its pricing power. If they price their latest chips too high, customers now have the option to simply use older chips or even switch to AMD’s alternatives.

Effectively, this erodes Nvidia’s competitive advantage and commoditizes their chips.

I agree that AI developers largely use CUDA, and Nvidia's ecosystem is still vast, but... DeepSeek’s model development costs are **27x cheaper** than the latest models developed by American companies. DeepSeek’s subscription costs **$0.50** compared to ChatGPT’s **$20** subscription. Granted, it’s a Chinese company, and there are valid security concerns, but they have published all their research openly—meaning any other company can leverage this research to build models at a lower cost.

Unless someone can definitively prove that Nvidia’s latest and greatest chips are absolutely necessary for developing the best AI models **and** that those best models will provide meaningful value to end customers, I don’t see how Nvidia can maintain its edge.",2025-01-27 21:39:06,0,79,investing
Markets are Overreacting to DeepSeek,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ibf2mt/markets_are_overreacting_to_deepseek/,"The markets are overreacting to the DeepSeek news. 

Nvidia and big tech stocks losing a trillion dollars in value is not realistic. 

I personally am buying more NVDA stock off the dip. 

So what is going on?

The reason for the drop:  Investors think DeepSeek threatens to disrupt the US big tech dominance by enabling smaller companies and cost-sensitive enterprises with an open source and low cost, high performance model. 

Here is why I think fears are overblown.

1. Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and other big tech firms have massive war chests to outspend competitors. Nvidia alone spent nearly $9 billion on R&D in 2024 and can quickly adapt to new threats by enhancing its offerings or lowering costs if necessary.

2. Nvidia’s dominance isn’t just about hardware—it’s deeply tied to its software ecosystem, particularly CUDA, which is the gold standard for AI and machine learning development. This ecosystem is entrenched in research labs, enterprises, and cloud platforms worldwide.

3. People have to understand the risk that comes with DeepSeek coming out of China. There will be major adoption barriers from key markets as folks worry about data security, sanctions, government overreach etc. 

4. US just announced $500b to AI infrastructure via Stargate. The government has substantial resourcing to subsidize or lower barriers for brands like Nvidia.

Critiques tend to fall into two camps…

1. Nvidias margins are going to be eroded 

To this I think we have to acknowledge that while lower margins and demand would impact the stock both of these are speculative. 

Increased efficiency typically increases demand. And Nvidias customers are pretty entrenched, it’s def not certain they will bleed customers. 

On top of that Nvidia’s profitability isn’t solely tied to selling GPUs. Its software stack (e.g., CUDA), enterprise services, and licensing deals contribute significantly. These high-margin revenue streams I would guess are going to remain solid even if hardware pricing pressures increase.

2. Open source has a number of relative advantages

I think open source is heavily favorited by startups and indie developers (Open source is strongly favored by Reddit specifically). But the enterprise buyer doesn’t typically lean this way.

Open-source solutions require significant internal expertise for implementation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. Large enterprises often prefer Nvidia’s support and commercial-grade stack because they get a dedicated team for ongoing updates, security patches, and scalability.",2025-01-27 17:44:35,2300,834,investing
Jevon's Paradox explains why DeepSeek's breakthrough should increase Nvidia and TSMC demand,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ibb4qa/jevons_paradox_explains_why_deepseeks/,">Jevons’ Paradox occurs when technological improvements or efficiency gains in resource use lead to an overall increase in resource consumption, rather than a decrease.

>**Initial Expectation**: Efficiency improvements (e.g., using less fuel per kilometer with more efficient cars) should reduce the consumption of the resource (fuel).

>**What Actually Happens**: Increased efficiency lowers the cost of using the resource, making it more accessible and attractive. This, in turn, can increase demand for the resource, potentially leading to greater overall consumption.

TSMC and Nvidia should be going up - not down - because of Deepseek. DeepSeek made OpenAI-level models cheap. Consumption will go drastically up. When consumption goes up, more Nvidia and TSMC chips will be purchased to power them.

Better models do not hurt Nvidia and TSMC. They help. TSMC and Nvidia don't care who is making the best models, as long as they make it on their hardware. I would sell TSMC/Nvidia if Deepseek trained their models on Chinese-made chips. But they trained them on 10k+ Nvidia GPUs made by TSMC.

Further more, it makes companies like OpenAI and Anthropic try even harder to build moat, which means going all in on data centers.

Finally, DeepSeek's own paper says to move to the next step, you need more compute power:

>Therefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, **advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning.**",2025-01-27 15:04:45,101,95,investing

TSMC: The Backbone of Global AI Chipmaking,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1i4cio2/tsmc_the_backbone_of_global_ai_chipmaking/,"Summary:

* **Global Leadership in AI Chips:** TSMC dominates the semiconductor market, producing over 90% of the globe’s most advanced chips, crucial for AI and HPC applications.
* **Geopolitical Risks:** Taiwan’s political tensions with China and U.S. export restrictions could affect TSMC, but its Arizona expansion helps mitigate risks.
* **Strong Market Position:** Partnerships with Nvidia, Apple, and AMD highlight TSMC’s technological edge, particularly with 3nm and 5nm nodes.
* **Investment Potential:** Despite challenges, TSMC's 2025 focus on AI growth, HPC revenue, and strategic diversification underscores its value as a long-term investment.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the global leader in advanced chip manufacturing, powering the AI revolution with its cutting-edge technology. As the primary supplier for tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and AMD, TSMC produces over 90% of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, which are essential across industries, from military systems to consumer electronics. The company’s dominance is driven by its consistent investment in leading-edge processes, including 3nm and 5nm nodes, which form the backbone of high-performance computing and AI applications.

However, TSMC faces significant geopolitical risks due to its concentration in Taiwan, a region under constant tension with China, which views Taiwan as a breakaway province. A disruption in TSMC’s operations could spark a global semiconductor crisis, impacting economies worldwide. To mitigate these risks, TSMC has been diversifying its production capabilities, with a notable $40 billion investment in its Arizona facility. This expansion strengthens supply chain resilience and ensures U.S. access to cutting-edge chips for AI, defense, and other critical technologies. Additionally, the U.S. CHIPs Act offsets the high operational costs of U.S.-based facilities and supports workforce development.

TSMC’s position as the backbone of the AI and HPC sectors is underscored by its strategic collaboration with Nvidia to produce advanced AI chips, such as the Blackwell series, further cementing its role as a critical supplier in this rapidly growing market. In Q3 2024, TSMC’s revenue grew by 36% year-over-year, driven by strong AI-related demand, and it projects that mid-50% of its total revenue will come from HPC applications in 2025.

Despite its strengths, TSMC must navigate industry challenges, including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market, declining PC and smartphone demand, and Wall Street's caution over potential growth slowdowns. Innovations in AI-driven consumer technologies and CES product launches could help revitalize these segments, with TSMC’s advanced chipmaking capabilities playing a central role.

From a valuation perspective, TSMC’s forward P/E ratio of 22.81 and PEG ratio of 0.73 suggest that while the stock trades at a premium, it remains reasonable given the company’s earnings growth and leadership in the AI sector. Geopolitical risks, while significant, are partially mitigated by the company’s diversification and reduced reliance on China, which now accounts for only 10% of its revenue.

TSMC has outperformed the semiconductor market benchmark (SMH) due to its advanced technology and strategic partnerships, recovering more quickly from market selloffs and demonstrating strong resilience. The company’s ability to balance geopolitical risks, invest in cutting-edge technologies, and sustain high demand for its products positions it as an attractive long-term investment.

In conclusion, TSMC’s leadership in semiconductor innovation and its critical role in AI chipmaking make it indispensable to the global technology industry. While challenges remain, its proactive approach to diversification and its focus on high-growth sectors like AI and HPC ensure its continued success and solidify its appeal as an investment in 2025.

TLDR: TSMC is a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, pivotal for AI chipmaking with unmatched technological dominance. While geopolitical risks and U.S.-China tensions pose challenges, the company’s strategic expansions, such as its Arizona facilities, and its robust growth in AI-driven markets make it a compelling investment in 2025.

CES Note On Nvidia (NVDA),https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1i36rox/ces_note_on_nvidia_nvda/,"Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO delivered the CES (Consumer Electronic Show) keynote on January 6th, 2025. An immensely popular event, with about 140,000 attendees, the charismatic Jensen drew a packed crowd. Jensen did not disappoint.

# There were three big announcements

# New Gaming Cards

Nvidia’s new line of RTX 50 Series gaming graphics cards is based on the company’s Blackwell chip architecture. Considering the massive leap Blackwell has made over Hopper, its previous iteration in data center applications, getting it to work in gaming is a huge deal – a massive improvement with superior rendering and higher frame rates for gamers.

# Digits

The Linux-based desktop computer with the GB 10 Grace Blackwell Superchip with a CPU and GPU. A first in its history at $3,000 “Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher, and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI,” Huang said.

It may seem like a niche product for high-end engineers/professors/scientists and researchers, but I think it’s a deliberate and excellent strategy to evangelize the product, through the folks who can develop use cases and apps that can further the market for cheaper at scale mass Digits in the future.

This is straight from the Nvidia playbook from the last two decades – they have always involved the scientific and research community from the start. I can bet a large number of these are going to be distributed free to campuses.

I think Digits will turn out to be a very consequential product for Nvidia – with several billion in revenue in a few years. But forecasts aside, what’s key is that Digits uses a scaled-down version of Nvidia’s Grace AI server CPU technology. It’s packaged in a Mac Mini-sized form factor with the help of Taiwan-based **MediaTek**, which Huang commended for its expertise in building low-power chips.

Quoting Tae Kim from Barron’s who authored an excellent book on Nvidia

>Over time, the logical move for Nvidia would be to scale down this CPU further for consumer Windows laptops. By integrating its graphics expertise, MediaTek’s power-saving capabilities, and the efficiency of Arm-based CPU technology, Nvidia could create a processor that offers leading graphics for gaming and high performance for productivity, along with long battery life. While prior Arm-based Windows PCs have struggled with software compatibility, Nvidia’s top-notch software engineering could make it work.

Huang strongly hinted that the introduction of Digits was a precursor to the PC market, even as there are questions about why Nvidia chose Linux over Windows – and we should hear more about that at their GTC conference in March.

It could shake up the moribund PC market, which has been suffering from a lack of growth rates after COVID-19. Desktop PCs and laptop computers still generate large revenues for **Intel** and **Advanced Micro Devices**, the primary makers of x86-based processors – a legacy that could give way to ARM-based processors, which Apple uses. Analysts expect Intel to generate $30 billion in revenue from its client computing business in 2024, according to FactSet, while AMD has $6.7 billion in revenue in its client segment.

Billions of potential new revenue are at stake for Nvidia, which is forecasted to make about $180Bn in sales in the 12 months ending January 2026. While data center takes up the largest share of revenue at about $150Bn of that pie and gaming, auto, and professional visualization (Omniverse) take the rest, a new source would help a great deal when data center revenue growth slows down.

In the past two years, Nvidia has monopolized the AI data center market with the best-designed, highest-performing chips. Nvidia would likely make a significant dent in the PC market as well as the new paradigm in edge computing with all the computing power and constant innovation and upgrades at its disposal.

# Cosmos

**Short Quantum thesis by Martin Shkreli:** [https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1876950624824177127](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1876950624824177127) Think what you want of the pharma bro, but he wrote an excellent piece on why he is short quantum. TLDR: the best quantum companies are GOOG and IBM. Both are too large to see any financial impact from quantum on the stock. However, these two stocks have the balance sheet to support massive/costly R&D in quantum that these smaller ""quantum"" companies don't have. He makes the interesting point that these companies went public (IONQ, Rigetti, D Wave, etc) because they are running out of money and need to raise money and dilute shareholders to stay afloat. IF they were that good, they would have been scooped up by IBM and GOOG already. He also notes the best quantum companies (outside of GOOG and IBM) are still private, so average people like you and I can't invest in them anyways. Basically the shitty quantum companies are the ones that are public right now.

 

**And most importantly, the computers don't work well. IONQ and RGTI computers are actually down right now.** [https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879607624569872443](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879607624569872443) & [https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879896705434591582](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1879896705434591582)

These computers aren't even online right now for IONQ and RGTI.

 

Basically this all seems like an emotional yolo into quantum. Most people don't understand it and the commerical applications are years and years, probably decades away. I would invest with caution as this has bubble written all over it , imo. Yes, I am short right now. ",2025-01-16 15:18:18,80,78,investing

Covered call strategies for Nvidia holders with low cost-base,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1i1hozs/covered_call_strategies_for_nvidia_holders_with/,"I currently hold ~900 shares of Nvidia at a cost base of sub $5, and am considering selling covered calls as a way to earn the premium with minimal risk.

My overall outlook on the company is still bullish in the long-term, and I do plan to hold some of my shares, but with the market cap at nearly $3.3T I do not see the same trend of parabolic growth continuing.

Nvidia makes up roughly 30% of my portfolio. As, long as I choose a strike price I am comfortable selling at, I wouldn’t mind being assigned IF I was to hold until expiry, which I wouldn’t plan on doing as I’ve learned it’s better to exit once you’ve realized 50% profit, and re-roll to a new strike/date.

Now the part that I am looking for advice on is how you determine the entry strategy of strike/date for the most efficient premiums? Opinions seem to vary with general consensus being weeklies or monthly and targeting strikes with a delta between 0.1 - 0.15 to reduce the risk of being assigned. As well, avoiding selling CCs on red days, close to earnings, or big new drop.

What is your CC strategy for entry? Do you target a specific % daily increase in price before entering? Do you use 50/100/200 day averages as a guideline? 

Would love to hear all the different strategies folks have employed, and how it has been working for you.

"If I'm hoping to retire BEFORE 63, should I be maxing my 401k contributions? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1i1d9t8/if_im_hoping_to_retire_before_63_should_i_be/,"30M for reference. 

I've been thinking about this for a few weeks now. I've been making max contributions to my company's 401k now for the last 3 years (since I joined) and across all 401ks that I have between my current and former employers, I'm sitting at 100k currently. Seeing the 100k for the first time felt really nice and it has made me realize how much closer I could be to retirement. 

Looking at a quick investment calculator, I'm on track to hit 1 million in my 401k in about 18 years assuming a modest 6% return rate with an average of 2k contributions per month (assuming no change to monthly contributions, so the true value here may be higher) which is my current personal goal. BUT 1million wouldn't immediately be enough for me to retire immediately (assuming I follow the 4% rule), and I'm hoping over time my periodic contributions will increase. 

But thinking about it, if I technically can't utilize this money properly until I'm in my early 60s (because it's been hammered in my head that we get penalized for pulling from a 401k before age ~63, with a few exceptions), is it worth it to keep contributing the max amount of money to a 401k vs a personal investment account? I have a personal investment account that is currently sitting at about 70k (VOO and some other personal tech stocks, like Microsoft, Nvidia) and I'm wondering if it would be a better move to just move more of my 401k contributions to my personal investment account instead? 

I'm not an expert in this area by any means, I've just been viewing all of these accounts as a form of savings accounts since I'm fortunate enough to be able to even set aside this money. And so this is the current situation that I'm in. I would love to be able to live a life not tied to a 9-5 and instead retire to work in an industry I enjoy at my own leisure(or get to a COAST amount minimum). 

Any input here would be appreciated. ",2025-01-14 18:49:22,26,38,investing

Questions from a 20-Year-Old Investor,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hzlrxr/questions_from_a_20yearold_investor/,"Hello everyone,

I’m a 20-year-old university student, and I’ve been dabbling in investments since I was 14. My approach so far has been quite basic, focusing on the following:

* Buying IPOs from family accounts and selling them 5 days later,
* Depositing funds into Binance dollar-backed coins up to the soft cap and earning interest,
* Mining Ethereum back in the day,
* Buying stocks during obvious dips and selling them a few weeks later,
* Allocating all remaining funds to Bitcoin.

My idea was to sell everything when Bitcoin reached $100,000—a threshold I set for myself—and then move on to other investment vehicles. However, I didn’t sell because I didn’t have a clear alternative investment in mind. Now, I’m determined to stick to this plan and explore new opportunities when Bitcoin hits $100,000 again.

# Questions on My Mind:

1. **AMD vs. Nvidia GPUs:** AMD GPUs often provide either better performance for the same price or similar performance for a lower price compared to Nvidia GPUs. Yet, Nvidia seems to dominate the consumer market. Why is that?
2. **Samsung vs. Apple:** A similar situation exists between Samsung and Apple. Despite Samsung offering competitive (or better) specifications for the price, Apple continues to dominate consumer preference.
3. **Stock Market Success:** In both cases above, Nvidia and Apple seem to outperform their competitors in the stock market, despite producing arguably lower-quality or lower-performance products. I understand the stock market doesn’t always reflect intrinsic value, but I’d appreciate book, documentary, or video recommendations to better understand the parameters that influence stock market success.
4. **Coca-Cola Stock Drop During Ronaldo's Incident:** When Ronaldo moved the Coke bottle during a press conference, Coca-Cola's stock value dropped. This seemed like an obvious short-term reaction, and therefore a perfect buying opportunity. Yet, many people sold low instead of buying for potential gains. Why do such clear opportunities often get overlooked?
5. **Resources That Enlightened You:** What resources (books, videos, or experiences) have helped you the most in understanding the stock market?",2025-01-12 12:36:43,0,3,investing

Carvana: A Compelling Opportunity Amid Market Volatility,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hwo2rt/carvana_a_compelling_opportunity_amid_market/,"**Summary**

* Carvana’s stock has dropped \~30% from its 2024 peak of $263, now trading at around $195, making it a more appealing entry point.
* The dip follows a short report by Hindenburg Research, but Carvana’s expansion in reconditioning facilities and improved wholesale-retail spreads are driving sustainable GPU growth.
* At \~23x adjusted EBITDA, Carvana’s valuation is more reasonable, and the stock becomes an even stronger buy if it dips into the $150 range.
* Macro factors like incoming tariffs on Canadian/Mexican imports may raise new car prices, shifting more market share to used car platforms like Carvana.

The market dynamics in 2025 are markedly different from those of 2024. Last year, the investment world was dominated by AI and large-cap companies like NVIDIA, leaving little room for under-the-radar opportunities. This year, however, savvy single-stock selection will likely be the key to outperforming the market. With its combination of strong revenue growth, expanding margins, and a now-corrected valuation, Carvana is a compelling pick for investors ready to dig deeper into individual names.

The short report from Hindenburg Research, while impactful in the short term, has created what many might see as a temporary distortion in Carvana’s valuation. While these reports often generate skepticism, the overall reaction from Wall Street analysts has been relatively defensive of Carvana’s position, suggesting that the sell-off may be overdone. The question remains: are short reports a distraction, or do they offer valid reasons to reassess a company’s fundamentals? For Carvana, the long-term outlook suggests the former.

The timing for investing in Carvana is compelling for several reasons. First, the stock’s valuation has undergone a meaningful reset, with its \~30% drop from its peak making the entry point significantly more attractive. At \~23x adjusted EBITDA, the valuation aligns more closely with the company’s expected growth, which analysts project at 17% year-over-year revenue growth for FY25. This revised valuation strikes a balance between growth potential and risk, offering a solid entry point for investors.

Second, macroeconomic conditions are shaping up in Carvana’s favor. Tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, expected to take effect soon, are likely to drive up the cost of new cars. This shift could divert more buyers to the used car market, where Carvana holds a significant position. Higher new car prices may also allow used car retailers like Carvana to raise their own prices, further widening the spreads between wholesale acquisition costs and retail sale prices. These dynamics should support continued GPU growth, which has already seen impressive gains in recent quarters.

Carvana’s Gross Profit Per Unit (GPU) is a central measure of its profitability, and the company has made significant strides in improving this metric. In the most recent quarter, GPU rose 20% year-over-year, reaching $7,685. This growth has been driven by several factors, including increased efficiency in retail vehicle sales, stronger performance in wholesale vehicle sales, and contributions from other revenue streams such as loan origination.

The breakdown of GPU for Q3 2024 highlights the company’s ability to drive profitability across its operations. Retail vehicle sales contributed $3,617 per unit, a 26% increase year-over-year. Wholesale vehicle sales added $571 per unit, up 53% year-over-year. While the contribution from wholesale marketplace sales declined slightly, the “other” revenue category—which includes loan originations—rose by 15%, contributing $2,945 per unit.

Loan origination has faced some headwinds, particularly with concerns about auto credit quality among buyers like Ally Financial. However, this represents a smaller portion of Carvana’s overall GPU growth, and the company has demonstrated that its core operations are more than capable of driving profitability. By focusing on economies of scale in its reconditioning facilities and leveraging wider wholesale-retail spreads, Carvana has built a solid foundation for sustainable GPU growth.

At a market cap of $37.59 billion and an enterprise value of $42.44 billion, Carvana’s current valuation reflects a company in transition. Analysts expect Carvana to generate $15.77 billion in revenue for FY25, with adjusted EBITDA projected to grow by 68%. This positions Carvana at \~22.9x EV/adjusted EBITDA, a much more palatable multiple for a company with its growth potential.

The company’s rapid growth in retail unit sales, combined with favorable macroeconomic conditions, sets the stage for continued expansion. With unit sales growing at 34% year-over-year in Q3 2024, and GPU benefiting from higher dealership spreads, Carvana has multiple levers to pull for sustained growth.

For investors, the current price of $195 represents a rare buying opportunity. If the stock slides further to the $160-$170 range, it becomes an even stronger case for adding to positions. The real question is whether Carvana can maintain its momentum in a market that’s increasingly challenging for high-growth companies. Does this valuation correction represent a turning point for the company, or will further challenges emerge? Share your thoughts and join the discussion—what’s your take on Carvana’s prospects in 2025?",2025-01-08 16:24:34,0,17,investing

[Advice] Opinions on covered call strategy with NVDA.,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hwbkje/advice_opinions_on_covered_call_strategy_with_nvda/,"I currently own about 64 shares of Nvidia stock at about $114 avg price. I will probably have the opportunity to make a full 100 shares within the next month or two, and I’ve been considering doing that just to run a covered call strategy with it while continuing to hold NVDA long-term.

Would I be better selling calls weekly or monthly? 

From what I can see I should be able to generate at least $350 to $400 a month or so which would be up to $4800 annualized. 

As of now, I believe I would just periodically reinvest the money directly back into Nvidia to build the position long-term. I also do realize I will pay capital gains on the money received from selling the calls. I have a small business with many legitimate write offs to hopefully help with that part.

 I understand the concept more or less and have used the strategy in the past with moderate success on much cheaper stocks. I also understand that I can buy back, roll up down, etc.

Nvidia: Expect Valuation To Soar Higher On 2025's AI Spending Increases,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hvywop/nvidia_expect_valuation_to_soar_higher_on_2025s/,"# Summary

* Nvidia’s 2024 revenue surged by 86% to $113.3 billion, with operating income doubling to $71 billion.
* Hyperscalers are expected to increase AI-focused capital expenditures by 50% in 2025, reaching $300 billion.
* Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell architecture offers up to 15x performance improvements, securing its 90% market dominance in AI GPUs.
* Competitors like AMD and Broadcom struggle with ecosystem integration and software optimization, solidifying Nvidia’s lead.
* Analysts project a 50x earnings multiple and a target price of $225 per share for 2025.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) enjoyed unprecedented financial success in 2024, driven by a wave of hyperscaler investments in data center infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Revenues soared by 86%, reaching $113.3 billion, while operating income more than doubled to $71 billion, signaling the company’s dominance in the AI sector.

Despite such robust growth, concerns over a potential slowdown are misplaced. The global push toward AI and machine learning shows no signs of waning. Leading technology giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Google are significantly expanding their high-performance computing capabilities to meet the surging demand for generative AI, large language models, and advanced AI applications.

In 2024, hyperscaler capital expenditures on data centers totaled approximately $200 billion. For 2025, this figure is projected to rise by 50%, hitting $300 billion. According to Morgan Stanley, Amazon and Microsoft are set to lead this spending spree with investments of $96.4 billion and $89.9 billion, respectively. Google and Meta will closely follow, allocating $62.6 billion and $52.3 billion to their AI-driven infrastructure.

This aggressive investment is underpinned by statements from top executives. Google’s CFO noted that while growth in capital expenditures won’t match the leap between 2023 and 2024, further increases are expected. Similarly, Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted plans for significant growth in infrastructure spending. Microsoft, too, has committed $80 billion for AI-oriented data center construction in fiscal 2025.

Nvidia, with its 90% share of the AI GPU market, is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this surge in spending. The release of its next-generation Blackwell architecture in early 2025 promises substantial performance gains, including up to 2.5 times the training performance of its Hopper GPUs and as much as 15 times higher inference capabilities in select benchmarks. These advancements, paired with Nvidia’s proprietary CUDA platform, reinforce its unassailable ecosystem of hardware and software solutions.

Competitors like AMD and Broadcom continue to face hurdles. AMD’s MI300X GPUs, while promising on paper, have failed to deliver comparable performance due to software deficiencies. Broadcom’s custom silicon projects, although intriguing, lack the versatility and support ecosystem Nvidia GPUs provide. Consequently, neither competitor poses a significant threat in the near term, with meaningful competition unlikely before 2026 or 2027.

# TL;DR

Nvidia’s remarkable 2024 growth, fueled by hyperscaler investments, will continue as AI spending surges 50% in 2025 to $300 billion. With its dominant 90% GPU market share and groundbreaking Blackwell architecture, Nvidia is well-positioned for further success.

The outlook for ASML & the lithography industry,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hvypmd/the_outlook_for_asml_the_lithography_industry/,"ASML just had its investor day, and the big takeaway was that they stuck to their long-term revenue forecast. That definitely calmed some nerves after the recent 2025 downgrade and a pretty lackluster year for orders.

But if you dig a little deeper, there are some interesting shifts happening in the semiconductor world, especially with AI shaking things up. One standout is memory—because datacenter GPUs rely so heavily on volatile memory, ASML seriously bumped up its growth forecast for DRAM wafer volumes over the next six years. On the flip side, NAND wafer growth took a pretty big hit:

https://preview.redd.it/879zmvu1ilbe1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb72ad6bb45052ab9028a48f22bf0eebcc38db69

A bunch of this growth is still gonna happen in the cloud, with AI training and inference servers pumping up the datacenter semis market and keeping that sweet CAGR looking good.

https://preview.redd.it/kcyqaikbilbe1.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc621546147cec2050d89625b5bce03b3e47eda4

As AI servers are both DDR and HBM intensive, this drives the strongly expected growth in the number of DRAM wafers mentioned above:

https://preview.redd.it/kxz7zmqfilbe1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b94ea2e9690ba2ddfe3a70bb5c3174efccb5b0

# ASML’s High-NA Outlook

ASML’s take on high-NA is basically, “We’re good to go—the tools are ready, we’re ready, and the ecosystem’s ready.” The only catch? Because the optics are bigger, these tools use a half-field exposure. In plain English, that means each shot only prints half the circuit design compared to older EUV systems, which isn’t great for productivity. But ASML says they’ve tackled this by speeding up how quickly the tool moves between fields.

Looking at the numbers, high-NA can crank out 175 wafers per hour (WPH), which is pretty solid, especially when you compare it to the latest version of regular EUV running at 220 WPH.

https://preview.redd.it/hjhkqgrp6mbe1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=467cc6c3d6172df2576d7851ea9f87c8b0ef3824

Bottom line—high-NA’s productivity is already impressive and even better than the older EUV systems ASML has out there. Plus, there’s a clear plan to make these tools even faster. Honestly, it’s wild to think about how chaotic EUV was a decade ago, with everyone freaking out about whether it would ever actually catch on.

# EUV just keeps leveling up

ASML had a tough time getting EUV off the ground at first—early tools couldn’t hit decent source power, and productivity kind of sucked. But since then, they’ve been on a mission to crank up source power and, in turn, boost productivity.

**Here’s the deal:** more source power means wafers get exposed faster, so the tools can churn through more wafers per hour. And more wafers per hour? That’s good news for everyone. ASML gets to slap higher price tags on its tools and rake in better margins, while customers lower their cost per wafer by cranking out more in less time.

https://preview.redd.it/qr388t047mbe1.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f6f7a585a1ae641ac1b6502cf8829dc0314bbdb

And this isn’t the end of the story. ASML’s already got a solid roadmap to keep pushing productivity even higher for both its low-NA and high-NA tools, so there’s plenty more to come.

# ASML’s 2030 Game Plan

ASML isn’t just about building cutting-edge litho tools—they’re also pros at mapping out long-term financial goals. Here’s how they do it: they take a guess at how many wafers will be pumped out at each node by 2030, then work backward to figure out how many exposures those wafers will need using their tools. They factor in everything—EUV, immersion, basic DUV, KrF, i-line, and metrology.

Next, they estimate how productive each tool will be, which helps them figure out how many tools need to be in the market and how many more they’ll need to sell. On top of that, they throw in around EUR 12 billion a year in revenue just for servicing all the tools already out there.

When you crunch the numbers, it adds up to somewhere between EUR 44 and 60 billion in revenue by 2030. And if you look at ASML’s track record, they’ve always hit or even beaten their targets. To make a solid return on this stock, we probably need to see them hit at least EUR 50 billion in revenue.

https://preview.redd.it/ju29xczm7mbe1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=21d0fc95ad1b6bcfada4949443545473b050fe87

As for margins, the guidance isn’t crazy aggressive. Honestly, the only reason the advanced semi industry is still scaling at all is because of ASML. Yet, weirdly enough, their margins are still lower than a lot of other big players in silicon. Go figure.

https://preview.redd.it/1bgzjxqp7mbe1.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c3f525119e7a75c74e04ffa9e2ac278fdbced1

# The Bull Case for ASML

**Let’s be real—ASML has basically been selling its tools at a discount.** It’s hands-down the most dominant player in the entire semiconductor game, with zero competition. Compare that to TSMC, which still has to keep an eye on Samsung, Intel, and maybe even Rapidus in advanced chipmaking. ARM has to watch out for RISC-V, Cadence and Synopsys are still duking it out, Nvidia’s losing some datacenter accelerator share to Broadcom and Marvell, and Analog Devices has to compete with Texas Instruments and Microchip in analog semis.

Don’t get me wrong—these companies are all in strong positions with solid growth prospects. But when it comes to a **true monopoly?** ASML is in a league of its own.

Now check this out—TSMC has consistently outperformed ASML when it comes to gross margins. And honestly, it’s mostly the American companies that know how to squeeze every dollar out of a dominant position. ASML could’ve been pulling in 60–65% gross margins like Nvidia has done in the past if they wanted to, but they’ve been way too nice about pricing. Let’s face it—this isn’t a business that should be settling for 50% gross margins.

https://preview.redd.it/ryfd39x68mbe1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed50e3ab62a6f1b4a2e77857294e9e92228741b6

# Conclusion

ASML is basically a bet on keeping Moore’s Law alive and pushing the scaling roadmap forward. Right now, the risk-reward balance still looks pretty good—mainly because TSMC and Intel are both making solid progress and have a clear game plan for the Angstrom era. Plus, their top-tier customers in high-performance computing are more than willing to shell out big bucks for the performance boosts these Angstrom chips deliver.

Looking at the current valuation, it’s actually pretty fair for what ASML’s got going on. Investors are basically paying the same kind of multiple they did six years ago—back when the outlook was just as strong as it is now and the stock absolutely skyrocketed.

The potential AI stocks in 2025,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hvvgf2/the_potential_ai_stocks_in_2025/,"When think of AI stocks, the first names that come to my mind is $NVDA and $MSFT. NVIDIA dominates the AI hardware market with its GPU technology, while Microsoft, through its partnership with OpenAI, has become a benchmark in the AI software space.

Meanwhile, Applovin ($APP) has excelled in AI-driven advertising, with its stock price doubling in November, attracting widespread attention. But beyond these giants, there are still many ""hidden champions"" lurking among the small-cap stocks.

For example, $BBAI, which focuses on defense AI, and UiPath ($PATH), specializing in enterprise automation, have garnered attention from the capital markets due to their deep market positioning.

But, I am currently eyeing on $BGM's recent stock price fluctuations.

Recently, BGM completed its acquisition of AIFU’s insurance platform, marking a significant step in its transformation into the AI insurance sector. AIFU’s “DuXiaoBao” platform, powered by Baidu’s big data, is a prime example of such integration. It combines Baidu’s 704 million monthly active users with AIFU’s 48 million insurance sales network. Currently, the platform covers over 16.8 million customers and 17.5 million households. With BGM’s integration of medical resources, the user base and insurance coverage are expected to expand significantly, driving explosive growth for the company.

Traditional insurance sales rely on broker networks, but ""DuXiaoBao"" is changing the game by using Baidu and AIFU’s deep data models to offer tailored insurance solutions. In the future, it might even analyze users’ lifestyle and health data to predict their health risks over the next 30 years and design personalized insurance products based on that. Imagine if AI told you there was a 95% chance you’d be sick in the next 20-30 years and recommended an insurance product accordingly—would you buy it? This “smart + privacy” insurance sales model is truly disruptive.

This approach bears a striking similarity to Tesla’s innovation: Tesla used vehicle data to personalize car insurance, disrupting the traditional auto insurance industry, while BGM is using big data to empower insurance products, revolutionizing the customer experience.

Looking ahead, BGM might even leverage OpenAI’s technology to take the ""DuXiaoBao"" platform global, offering personalized health and insurance services to users worldwide. This vision of globalization and technological integration opens up even greater growth potential for the company.

BGM’s market cap is currently just around $60 million, compared to insurance giants like Prudential (market cap around $21.7 billion) and Prudential Financial (market cap around $46.1 billion), which are dozens of times its size.

Tesla's Deliveries Disappoint: Time To Take Profits (Rating Downgrade),https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hv5dc3/teslas_deliveries_disappoint_time_to_take_profits/,"**Summary**

* Tesla's stock remains overvalued despite disappointing vehicle delivery numbers and slowing growth.
* The surge in Tesla's stock price is driven by enthusiasm for AI advancements, Elon Musk's charisma, and Donald Trump's election victory rather than improvements in the company's core business fundamentals.
* At 126 times projected earnings, Tesla’s valuation is far higher than both industry peers and even Nvidia, making it increasingly difficult to justify its current price.
* The company's challenges, including declining deliveries, suggest that much of its upside potential has already been priced in.
* Investors should consider taking profits while the stock is trading at near-record highs.

Tesla’s stock has been riding a wave of unprecedented enthusiasm, with its price reaching all-time highs despite recently published delivery numbers that fell short of analysts' expectations. This discrepancy highlights a growing disconnect between Tesla’s market valuation and its actual performance. The company, once known for its relentless growth and innovation, delivered fewer cars in 2024 than in 2023, marking its first-ever year of declining deliveries. Despite this, Tesla’s stock price has surged by 63% in 2024, demonstrating how much investor sentiment rather than fundamental growth is driving its valuation.

In my October analysis, I discussed how Tesla’s slowing delivery growth and declining net income, despite aggressive price cuts, were becoming evident concerns. Even the highly anticipated robotaxi event failed to deliver the excitement that investors had hoped for, leading to a drop in the stock price at the time. While Tesla was already trading at a premium then, its valuation has only become more stretched in the months since.

The most recent data on Tesla’s deliveries reveals troubling trends. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company delivered 495,570 vehicles, falling short of the 512,300 deliveries expected by analysts. This shortfall contributed to a total of 1.79 million vehicles delivered for the year, a slight decline from the 1.81 million delivered in 2023. While the drop in deliveries may seem modest, it is significant as it breaks Tesla’s streak of consistent year-over-year growth, which had previously been a hallmark of its success. This is especially notable given the company’s reliance on vehicle sales for approximately 80% of its revenue. Without sustained growth in this area, the rationale for holding Tesla as a growth stock diminishes considerably.

From 2020 to 2023, Tesla experienced remarkable growth in deliveries, with annual numbers climbing steadily. However, 2024 marked a departure from this trend, with sales stagnating and then declining. Quarterly delivery figures also highlight the slowdown, with growth peaking in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently stalling. This lack of growth is especially concerning for a company that reinvests all earnings into future expansion rather than paying dividends to shareholders. Tesla’s business model hinges on its ability to grow continuously, and the absence of that growth undermines its investment appeal.

Despite these challenges, Tesla’s stock has soared, buoyed by investor excitement over its advancements in artificial intelligence, Elon Musk’s magnetic persona, and the political implications of Donald Trump’s recent election victory. Musk has repeatedly emphasized Tesla’s position as a leader in AI and robotics, which has further fueled optimism among investors. Additionally, Tesla’s stock experienced significant gains following the November election, with investors speculating that Trump’s administration might ease regulations related to self-driving technology. However, such regulatory changes would only be beneficial if Tesla achieves full autonomy, an ambitious milestone that remains elusive.

Tesla’s valuation underscores the risks of the current enthusiasm. The stock is now trading at an extraordinary 126 times projected earnings, a multiple that far exceeds even AI powerhouse Nvidia, which trades at around 42 times earnings. Comparisons with legacy automakers further highlight the disparity. Tesla’s market cap of $1.2 trillion is greater than that of the next 20 largest automakers combined, yet it delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than in 2023. This disconnect raises questions about whether Tesla’s valuation can be justified in the absence of tangible growth.

Tesla’s performance relative to Nvidia provides another perspective on the stock’s overvaluation. While both companies have benefited from their association with AI, Tesla’s stock has outperformed Nvidia’s despite facing significant headwinds in its core business. This suggests that investor enthusiasm for Tesla may be outpacing its actual achievements.

Although Tesla remains a leader in EV production and is recognized for its innovative technologies, including AI and robotics, these factors are already priced into the stock. The company’s market leadership positions it well to benefit from long-term trends in EV adoption, but its challenges in the short term, including declining deliveries and uncertain profitability from new ventures, make its current valuation appear precarious.

In conclusion, Tesla’s stock is trading at unsustainable levels given its recent performance. While the company’s technological advancements and market leadership are undeniable, its reliance on investor sentiment rather than business fundamentals makes it a risky investment at these prices. Taking profits now would allow investors to capitalize on the stock’s near-record highs while avoiding potential losses should the market reassess Tesla’s valuation. While the enthusiasm surrounding Tesla may persist in the short term, prudence suggests that this is an opportune moment to exit the position.

Achieved my first milestone after 3 years!,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfr8dz/achieved_my_first_milestone_after_3_years/,"After 3 years of investing, I've finally achieved my goal of investing my first $100,000! This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*

I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. 

**Investment strategy:**

1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  
2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  
3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  
4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*

I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.

**Looking forward:**

Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!

My next goal will be to reach $300,000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think? Achievable?",2024-12-16 19:27:44,76,27,investing
$AVGO Analysis [DD]  ----,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfpel0/avgo_analysis_dd/,"Broadcom(AVGO)

This ticker is surfing multiple growth waves, including the AI boom, 5G rollout, and enterprise software takeover. My research reflects a top-tier supplier of custom chips powering cloud titans like AWS and Google Cloud, and its recent $61 billion VMware acquisition just opened a fat new cash spigot with juicy profit margins. With AI and 5G still in the early innings, Broadcoms got a serious baller vibe rn.

Financially, Broadcom is a cash cow. Were talking monster gross margins at 75% and a cash-printing machine generating around $16 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Dividends are popping off, up 24% annually over five years, and the current yield at 2.3% isnt too shabby for a growth beast.

On valuation, this stock looks like a steal. Trading at \~20x forward earnings, its way cheaper than high-flyers like NVIDIA, despite packing serious growth potential. Analysts are eyeing the $1,000+ zone for the stock in the next few years, which spells a tasty upside from here.

The risks? Regulatory heat and a macro slowdown could throw some shade, but Broadcoms diversified playbook spreads the risk nicely.

TL;DR: Broadcom is a money-printing machine crushing it in semis and software. With AI, 5G, and VMware in its corner, this one’s a no-brainer. Slap a $950 short-term target on it, and long-term, its got legs to hit $1,200+.

This is a strong buy imho especially with guidance into 2027!!

2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfjvh8/25_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

>\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~24% and \~16%.",2024-12-16 14:08:16,832,184,investing

Question on whether I should take some profit on Nvidia and reinvest.,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hdbra9/question_on_whether_i_should_take_some_profit_on/,"For context, I am 25 years old and from the UK. 

I bought 5 shares of Nvidia in late May 2020. 
Fast forward to today and they have obviously risen considerably and I have seen multiple stocks splits. 

I have been investing in SP500 and other stocks in the meantime too, and would say that my stake in NVDA now accounts for about 38% of my portfolio.

My question is whether I should reduce my position, take out the profits and put them back into an ETF?

Alternatively, I’m thinking that  I’m young and can take the risk to see a potential greater upside over the next 5-10 years?

NVDA Fundamental Analysis w/ Charts,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hcvdh7/nvda_fundamental_analysis_w_charts/,"There is no shortage of dollars or bullshit when it comes to NVDA, the world's AI GPU hero of heroes. And with NVDA's revenue and profits not just increasing but multiplying in such a short timespan, investors want to know is it still a good time to buy, to catch the AI wave, as it builds and crashes upon the world, both that of capital investment and the greater world at large. 

Revenue and profits multiplying:

And here’s the chart that shows the impact of ChatGPT on the share price and earnings:

https://imgur.com/SxhIF9z

The top line is the price investors are paying. 

The bottom line is what those investors are getting, so to speak (NVDA’s net income over the previous year (trailing twelve months)) 

The vertical line roughly represents ChatGPT hitting 100m users with the line at 2023 January 1st and ChatGPT reportedely hitting 100m users sometime in that month of January according to Reuters and The Guardian.

The firm will present you with the basic facts about NVDA, not as, and never as, a financial recommendation, but as an introduction to its financials, to give you a better idea if it's even worth your time to further explore NVDA as a company and potential vehicle of investment. The firm does not want you to be falsely misled into thinking we can offer you expertise on NVDA, we cannot. We can however answer the questions that we would expect any man who'd risk his capital to answer. How much money does NVDA make? How much do they have? And you would think, most importantly, how much has NVDA paid their previous investors so far? And while we don't believe the answers to these questions to justify investment, this firm adamantly believes that not knowing the answers to these questions is unacceptable for those who do or would choose to buy common stock in NVDA. 

In short, you'd have to be a fucking idiot to lend your money to a company without reading our charts and commentary, or the equivalent there of. To assess the full risk of NVDA however, will require a much deeper dive than a single blog post can provide.

Let’s take a look at what investors were thinking during the ChatGPT hype and whether that investment panned out at a fundamental rather than speculative level. In other words, did NVDA actually make more money or did its share price just go up?

https://imgur.com/wRnNWlD

This graph shows what percentage of NVDA’s share price was being represented by the money it had made (ttm net income/shares/share price). This 10 year low during 2023, shows unequivically that there was in fact investment hype during this time, that the price per earnings went very high as people were willing to accept less than 1% earnings just to get in on the hype. Why would investors accept such low earnings per dollar? Because these investors anticipated that the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and the AI hype around it, would mean a growth for NVDA that would more than make up for the price they paid. So were they dumb? Did they overpay? Let’s find out! 

For our example, we’ll imagine an investor that bought sometime in February after the 100m user threshold was announced:

February 15th, 2023
  $22.75 price
  $0.175 net income
  $0.175/$22.75 = ~0.8% 


December 10th, 2024
  ~$2.57 net income
  $2.57/$22.17 = ~11% 


If an investor had bought sometime in February after the news of the 100m users was released. Let’s say for example February 15th at a closing price of approximately $22.75 per share they would have bought when NVDA’s trailing twelve month net income was about $0.175 (17.5 cents) per share, or about 0.8% of the price of the share at that time. Today, those same shares carry about $2.57 per share, a wopping 10x increase (almost 15 actually) in just 2 years. $2.57/$22.75 = ~11%, which means investors that bought in on the AI hype are already seeing the net income of their shares exceed the growth rate of the money supply (M2), which is about 7-8%. Meaning that NVDA isn’t just earning more dollars, its earning a greater share of the economic pie, and in a world where profits are actually returned to investors, would mean beating inflation (at least from a micro perspective). Now whether this cash that NVDA is reporting to generate will ever actually make it back to the shareholder is another story.

Now that we’ve seen that buying (even when the fundamental value of the shares was at its lowest) has paid off, let’s take a look at how much money NVDA actually has:

https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj
https://imgur.com/6KPxWte

As you can see, NVDA has almost no money relative to its price. The market’s pricing of NVDA is derived principally from the money it is supposed to make in the future, rather than the present value of the company.

This is not what the firm would deem a good fundamental investment. Why? Because one would be paying a future price for future value, rather than the current price for its current value. Furthermore, the market is a game of desperation, and if shareholders are desperate for money, they should be offering their shares below the liquidation value of the company. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush after all. 

However, if one understands that NVDA’s price has been based on the growth of its earnings, and if one can also see that the growth of said earnings has gone up, but its stock price has gone down (as is the case for NVDA at the time of this post ~$135) then one could speculate that the market will not only price NVDA’s earnings higher than they are currently being priced, but that the market will actually price its earnings higher than in the previous quarters unless the market believes that NVDA’s future growth will be lower. The firm believes that within the next 3 months, NVDA will almost certainly attain new all time highs. In fact, we believe the passive participant in the market, will be genuinely surprised by how high the price of NVDA will go. At the time of this post, the firm has no positions in NVDA. An associate of the firm has exposure to NVDA through long options on the SNP500. A position the firm feels is not worth mentioning as longing the SNP500 might as well be a long on inflation.

So NVDA has made all this money? How much of that money has been returned to shareholders? 
https://imgur.com/RANJVwo

As you can see by that line at the bottom, almost none. About half of the money has been spent on share buybacks and when the company’s evaluation is 50x the money that it makes and 50x the money that it has, these buybacks only break even once the company has actually grown 50x (less so if you’re only evaluating the company on past earnings and not the amount of money it actually has, in this case, you might only want a 5x to consider yourself breaking even) . I’d much rather have my money now and use it to make more money, than wait around for NVDA to 50x. But NVDA doesnt give shareholders the option of how to spend their own money or how to evaluate the company. They don’t give the money to the shareholder to decide whether they want to wait for a 50x gain on NVDA. They’ve decided they’ll spend it for you. Not on growing the company or acquiring others, but by buying their own stock. 

Now that we can understand a basic view of NVDA’s finances and how it relates to its price, let’s take a glance at some of the more sinister aspects of NVDA.

First is this little tidbit the firm discovered while reading NVDA’s Q2 filing:
https://imgur.com/b438cbJ

NVDA expects you to follow **ALL**  6 of its listed social media accounts and will be leaving out material information in its 10Q and 10k filings that will only be available in its listed social media accounts. This is clearly unethical, and our firm at this time questions whether this intent to distribute exclusive material information across 6 different channels is even legal. Though we do not have the legal training or background to make a claim one way or the other, we would like to assume that the system in place would not allow such a thing.

Now lets throw a bone to the hardware guys. If you’ve never heard of Moore’s Law, you can skip this section as trying to understand what Moore’s Law means will get in the way of seeing the blatant contradiction between NVDA’s CEO and his company’s own SEC filings. For your time:

   Moore's Law is the observation that the  number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years.

   The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel

   From Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law


So why is the firm bringing up Moore’s Law? We don’t even know what half that sentence means, and we certainly wouldnt be able to explain the nuances of NVDA’s hardware products. Well, there’s one thing we do know, it’s how to bullshit. So let’s wind back the clocks to the end of 2022. September. Right before entering Q4.

“Moore’s Law’s dead,” Huang said, “And the ability for Moore’s Law to deliver twice the performance at the same cost, or at the same performance, half the cost, every year and a half, is over. It’s completely over, and so the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time, unfortunately, is a story of the past.”

Source: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moores-laws-dead-nvidia-ceo-jensen-says-in-justifying-gaming-card-price-hike-11663798618



Ok, so going into Q4, Moore’s Law is dead. The CEO said it’s over baby. Rapid growth is a thing of the past. That means the market should be lowering its growth expectations for NVDA right?

https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj
https://imgur.com/6KPxWte

But it did the opposite. Investors were willing to pay more for less, implying they actually expected NVDA’s long term growth rate to increase not decrease. Almost as if the market knew what NVDA would end up publishing in its Q4 filing:

Source: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001045810/000104581023000017/nvda-20230129.htm

(10k filed Feb 24, 2023)

So not only did the company contradict the CEO’s statements made in the September prior to the reported quarter, now theyre actually ahead of Moore’s law, and according to them, giving the entire industry a path forward. What the fuck. 🤣

And to finish things off, we’ll put on our tin foil hats. The firm does not know how to verify the veracity of the following information. 

There has been a short report put out by Hindenburg Research regarding SMCI:

    https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/



The firm has no idea if the information reported is true. So this last section is just for fun. If the information in the report is true, then the firm would conclude that it paints the picture that SMCI has been funneling money out of the company into other companies, out of shareholder hands, into the hands of insiders and their network of family and friends. SMCI’s biggest customer? NVDA. In other words, if the allegations are accurate, the biggest chunk of money that SMCI funneled out came from NVDA. So it’s really not outside the realm of possibility that NVDA was intentionally buying from SMCI knowing where the money was ending up. The firm is not in the practice of lawsuits or building criminal cases. So the firm cannot and has no intention of doing so here for you now. The firm, however, is also not stupid. And the fact that all this money the company is making is not ending up in shareholders pockets, really isnt helping the “management would never steal from shareholders” fantasy that many would like to be the truism that must be disproved with mountains of evidence. It should have to be proven that the money is being returned to investors, not the other way around. When the vast majority of the profits dont go to the investors, which we can see from the dividend chart, but get spent on buybacks at 50x multiples, well people start to listen when accusations start to be made about money being funneled into other companies.

We’ve learned a lot. We’ve seen the impressive growth of NVDA’s earnings and how they relate to its price and the general hype around AI. We’ve shown that the company has barely any money at all and is being priced on future earnings. We’ve shown where some of this money is going. And we even got to put on our conspiracy hats for a little bit. 

And that is our fundamental analysis of NVDA, the AI giant. The good, the bad, and the fugly. Thanks for tuning in.

Portfolio allocation talk,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h9oz25/portfolio_allocation_talk/,"Hello all, after months of my own research I've made a portolio. I want to preface this by saying this is not a post looking for advice. I am just wanting to tell you all the investments I've made and the reasons behind them. Also, there is some overlap between my individual picks and my ETF picks. I know.

**First, the foundation**

Like any smart investor you need a solid base. Something that will grow steadily and won't make you want to sell out when there is an inevitable market crash. This is why for my first pie, I have gone with 80% VUAG and 20% IGLA.

**Tech Focus**

People may say that my portfolio is too heavily weighted towards the USA and tech, I think the tech giants like Apple etc are not going anywhere. So my allocations are as follows,

Amazon- Moving into the AI space with Nova, Revenue growing steadily YOY.

Microsoft- Almost in the 'too big to fail' category. Not going anywhere and an easy choice IMO.

Alphabet- Recovered well and quickly after 2022 crash. Massive AI player. Easy choice

Apple- Still most popular in the Phone space. Can only see this stock going one way.

Meta- Absolutely flying in recent years. Hopeful Zuck will keep it up.

ASML- Riskier pick but believe they will have a good year next year. Looking 4-5 years into the future with this one.

Nvidia- Don't think I need to say too much with this choice. Looking long term, very excited about this one.

IonQ- Main player in quantum computing space, looking at some volatile years upcoming but I have faith that they could be huge in 5+ years.

**Consumer Focus**

Costco wholesale- Almost unshakeable business model, no strong competition IMO.

Pets at home- Smaller allocation for this one. Seems undervalued to me as people are always going to treat their pets. Will keep tabs on this one as still unsure.

Procter and Gamble- Been around for a million years. Very stable with dividend growth YOY.

Walmart- Consumer powerhouse in USA, strong financials and IMO not going anywhere,#

**Finance Focus**

Berkshire Hathaway- Trust in Buffett, no pressure from short term market trends.

Intuit- Dividend growth YOY, in an incredible place financially.

JP Morgan and Chase- In the 'too big to fail' category in my opinion. Involved in so many industries so not dependent on one for revenue.

MasterCard- Very able to adapt to the market, only risk is inflation IMO.

PayPal- After share price crash in 2022. Revenues didn't faulter and net income bounced back within the year. Undervalued IMO.

S&P Global- Adapting well to new tech such as AI. Been around forever.

**Real Estate Focus**

Realty income- Unshaken by the market crashes in past 20 years. Dividend Growth YOY.

VICI properties- Predictable revenue due to triple net leases. In a strong financial postion.

I think I have a good mix of sectors and stability/growth. I am not looking for advice but will take onboard any criticism.

What is your thought on my portfolio and strategy?,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h7mstv/what_is_your_thought_on_my_portfolio_and_strategy/,"I'm 30M. I recently started investing in ETF & individual stocks. Below is my portfolio I figured it out myself, but I am not sure if it is reasonable in the long run, and I want to hear other people's opinions, comments, and criticism on it. I put in a lump sum (a large amount of my saving money after I excluded emergency money) and plan to DCA monthly.

**ETF 75%**  
\- iShares Core MSCI World (Acc) - IWDA

**Individual stocks 25%**  
\- **Tech Growth 12%:** Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Palantir, Nvidia, Tesla  
\- **(High-)dividend 5%:** Siemens, Merck & Co, Swiss Re, Exxon Mobil, McDonald  
\- **Consumer defensive 3%:** UnitedHealth, Mastercard, Cola  
\- **Personal favorite 3.5%:** Garmin, Air Product and Chemicals, Walmart, Rolls-Royce, Airbus  
\- **Aerospace & Defensive 1.5%**: Rocket Lab, Howmet, RTX Corp

The reason that my portfolio contains more than 20 stocks is that I want to diversify it in terms of the stocks, not types of assets. 

My concerns/questions are:

1. I'm not sure if I hold too many stocks in the same category (e.g. tech stocks) and most of them are already covered by the IWDA ETF.
2. I'm also considering holding only 1 or 2 high-dividend stocks like AbbVie, instead of 5 dividend stocks. Is it a good idea?
3. My long-term plan follows ""time in the market > timing the market"". So I plan to split DCA in half and put in ETF and stocks equally. I also read about the [Enhanced DCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b40399/enhanced_dollar_cost_averaging/). Statistically, is the Enhanced DCA worth a try?

All suggestions are welcome. I'm happy to give more information and appreciate any help you can provide. :)",2024-12-05 23:13:24,0,3,investing

Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h28t5b/talking_with_my_dad_about_nvidia_over_thanksgiving/,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

Advice needed. Should I pull off the market temporarily?,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h1zg7z/advice_needed_should_i_pull_off_the_market/,"I’m 38, living in the U.S., and looking for some guidance on my Roth IRA investments. This account is primarily for my daughter’s future education and my retirement (I also have a pension to fall back on). I’m still working and ham 22 years from retirement.

Currently, I have about $13k invested in this account. Most of it is in FGBRX (a blue-chip fund), with smaller positions in NVidia and AMD.

The market has been performing well, but I’m nervous about a potential downturn, especially if Trump re-enters office. Tariffs seem to be back on the table, and from everything I’ve read and watched, they seem like a bad idea economically. I’m worried a market crash could be looming.

I know the conventional wisdom says to stick it out and let the market ebb and flow over the long term. But I’m considering pulling out of the market temporarily—just for a few months—to see how things play out.

$Dell Earnings Down 11%..,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h0q75c/dell_earnings_down_11/,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024. 

Thoughts? Should I continue to hold? Or sell during the holiday rally? My portfolio time horizon is short giving I plan to liquidate July 2024 to buy a house. ",2024-11-26 23:31:47,61,36,investing

"MPWR should be in your portfolio, TODAY!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gpr2rt/mpwr_should_be_in_your_portfolio_today/,"Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) has been a powerhouse in the semiconductor space for years, bringing top-tier power solutions across hot sectors like cloud, telecom, automotive, industrial, and consumer tech. Established back in ‘97 out of Kirkland, WA, MPWR has built a solid rep as a go-to for high-performance power components.

**Recent Stock Action**

In October, MPWR traded in the $950 price range and as of November 12, 2024, MPWR is trading at $638.26, taking a hit of about 13.98% from the previous close. It saw an intraday high of $689.00 and bottomed out at $610.00. Price action lately has been choppy, but analysts are still very much on board with this stock.

**Analyst Ratings and Price Targets**

Despite the pullback, the Street remains bullish on MPWR. Here’s the rundown:

* **Truist Financial**: Analyst William Stein kept his ""Buy"" rating on October 31, boosting his target from $918 to $994.
* **Stifel Nicolaus**: Back on October 9, Stifel held the ""Buy"" call and upped the target to $1,100.
* **TD Cowen**: Matt Ramsay reiterated a ""Buy"" rating on October 31, tagging it with a $975 target.
* **Rosenblatt Securities**: Also bullish, reissuing a ""Buy"" on October 29 with an $880 target.
* **Needham & Company**: On November 11, Quinn Bolton reaffirmed his ""Buy"" rating with a $950 target.

With an average price target around $942.40, that’s roughly a 23% upside from here. MPWR is a consensus ""Strong Buy.""

**Latest Developments**

The stock took a 15% dive on November 11 after rumors hinted at MPWR losing some Nvidia business. Management fired back, denying any issues with Nvidia, and the analysts stepped in to support the stock. It’s a shake-up, but nothing management isn’t handling.

**The Bottom Line**

MPWR is still a major player with a strategic foothold in high-growth sectors. Despite the recent noise, analysts are holding steady on their bullish stance. For long-term growth in semis, MPWR has the fundamentals to keep driving forward.",2024-11-12 18:05:57,0,3,investing

Nvidia is replacing rival chipmaker Intel

Nvidia shares have climbed over 170% so far in 2024 after jumping roughly 240% last year, as investors have rushed to get a piece of the AI chipmaker. Nvidia’s market cap has swelled to $3.3 trillion, second only to Apple.

At a crossroads with investments ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Money/comments/1h7rdhw/at_a_crossroads_with_investments/,"32, inheriting a 75K trust soon, I don’t know much about out the positions but my Grandpa started it for me in 2016 with 50K. I don’t plan on changing anything except for investing the dividends and adding to it. 
I also have 230ishK in crypto.  
TSP 35k last time I checked a few weeks ago. 
Have another stock account with 15-20K in it that I haven’t checked in awhile and is only McDonalds stock. 
Gross 52k
I have a 6 month emergency fund as well and add small amounts to it. 

No home ownership yet, that should come in the next year. 

I’m starting to buy stocks again as I’ve mostly just bought crypto since 2019 and plan on selling most this next year. Bought a little NVIDIA, and looking at the mag 7 stocks. I’ve looked at SCHD before it split, and now that dividend and price per share look really appealing and would give me some of the exposure I want. 

I’ll say I’m probably like a lot of folks on here as I want to get to a point where I don’t HAVE to work or at least go part time for the insurance and to keep my brain busy. But part of my plan with the crypto proceeds is to buy land and build tiny homes to rent out for income.  Do you think SCHD is a good move at my age? 

I appreciate the advice to come, but please save the “crypto is risky comments” or whatever you have to say. I know it is and I bought earlier enough to not have to worry about that as much as all the folks FOMO’ing in now. I also did not buy shit coins or meme coins.  ",2024-12-06 02:55:03,4,19,Money

i’ve saved about 20k while living with my parents. I have around 5k in the stock market. Mostly in NVIDIA (a little in doge crypto that I bought forever ago lol). Then I have 15k in a HYSA. 

My ultimate goal is to move my daughter and I out of my family’s house but realistically, i need to make more money unless i’m planning on using all my savings. I graduate with my masters next year and should hopefully have better job prospects.

I just want to know if you guys have better advice on where I should put my money? The savings is for a house most likely. I know i want to rent an apartment for a bit and save more once Im making more money. I’m just scared that I put it in a stock and need the money 4-5 years from now and it’s down.

Currently living with my brothers and paying $400.00 to help them out and car insurance $189.00. Most of my expenses are in food, eating out daily.

I currently have 120k in a brokerage account, 25k in a 401k and little debt (only school but it's like 4k).

I've been to countless interviews and its not an issue of finding a job, they've offered but I feel like the pay range 50-60k is just not enough to survive here? I'm not a loser but I do feel like giving up, is this what I'm destined to earn?

I've been playing with trading options and have managed to make money on the side in order to survive and not deplete my 120k. (Nvidia has been good), made $6200 in premium (though I take 30% of that for taxes) but it helps.

Not even sure why i'm writing this post now that I got to this point. Maybe I just wanted someone to hear me out since I don't have anyone to speak about the issues I'm facing. Any criticism or advice would be appreciated.",2024-11-08 04:08:36,15,30,Money

I only just started investing in my retirement 2.5 years ago. I currently have 32k invested in my works 401K into Vanguard Target 2065. I wanted to diversify a bit more so I am now contributing 6% (my works match) to the 401K and invest the rest into a Roth IRA into FXAIX (My brokerage is Fidelity). I’m married with kids and my wife doesn’t work so my tax bracket is pretty low. This seems like a good reason to invest in a ROTH as the taxes I pay now are fairly low. 

My questions is this. I’m so young that the Target Date fund seems like I’m missing out on a lot of potential growth. I feel like since I’m young now would be the time to take risk. Not big/dumb risk like “let’s throw my retirement into NVIDIA!” But something with slightly better returns like maybe VOO (similar to FXAIX).

# Tesla Fourth-Quarter Results Miss Estimates As Automotive Revenue Drops 8%

Tesla’s Q4 results weren’t exactly electric—profits missed estimates, automotive revenue fell 8%, and margins shrank to 6.2%. But none of that mattered once Elon Musk started talking about Tesla’s glorious future. The stock initially dipped, then flipped positive after Musk reassured investors that 2025 will be the year Tesla returns to growth. With plans for a cheaper EV, self-driving tech, and even humanoid robots, Musk essentially told Wall Street: “Ignore the numbers, focus on the dream.”

**Self-Driving Hype and a White House Connection**  
  
Musk is doubling down on AI, telling investors that fully autonomous Teslas will hit the streets this year and that the Cybercab—a driverless taxi—will arrive in 2026. Meanwhile, his growing influence in Washington could shape Tesla’s trajectory. As one of Trump’s key advisors, Musk has a front-row seat to potential regulatory shifts that could benefit his AI and self-driving ambitions. However, Trump’s proposed tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports could dent Tesla’s bottom line, given its supply chain reliance on both countries.

**Investors Are Betting on the Vision, Not the Numbers**  
  
Despite rising competition and an aging product lineup, Tesla’s market value has soared post-election, driven by optimism around Musk’s political clout. But reality looms: margins are shrinking, demand is softening, and price wars—especially in China—aren’t letting up. Tesla still holds a dominant position in the EV market, but it needs more than hype to maintain its $1.5 trillion valuation.

**2025, Make or Break for Tesla:** Musk insists Tesla will be “ridiculously good” by 2027, but investors won’t wait that long. The next 12 months will be critical, with cheaper EVs expected to revive demand, and self-driving tech facing regulatory and technological hurdles. For now, Tesla remains a high-stakes bet on Musk’s ability to turn grand visions into reality—and avoid getting lost in his own hype.

# Big Tech’s AI Binge: Meta Bets Big, Microsoft Hits a Wall

**Zuckerberg’s AI Ambitions Hype Up Investors**  
  
Mark Zuckerberg is on a mission to make Meta the AI kingpin. During Meta’s Q4 earnings call, he predicted that 2025 would be the year Meta AI reaches a billion people and that its AI engineering agents would rival mid-level software engineers. Despite a weaker-than-expected Q1 revenue forecast, the stock climbed 4.5% after hours as investors rallied behind Zuck’s AI-fueled optimism. Meta’s ad business remains strong, with Q4 revenue beating expectations at $48.4 billion, even as the company prepares to slash 5% of its workforce to “make space for new hires.”

**Microsoft’s AI Boom Faces a Data Center Bottleneck**  
  
Meanwhile, Microsoft’s AI-powered growth is hitting a roadblock—there simply aren’t enough data centers to keep up with demand. While Azure AI services surged 157%, the company warned that cloud growth would remain sluggish until it expands capacity. That cautious outlook sent Microsoft’s stock down 5% in extended trading, despite Q4 revenue of $69.6 billion, slightly ahead of estimates. CFO Amy Hood reassured investors that the bottleneck should ease by the end of the fiscal year, but Wall Street remains skeptical of its $80 billion AI infrastructure investment.

**The DeepSeek Disruption**  
  
Both Meta and Microsoft are plowing billions into AI, but a Chinese startup just threw a wrench into their plans. DeepSeek’s latest AI model claims to rival the best of U.S. tech at a fraction of the cost, sparking a $1 trillion market wipeout earlier this week. While Meta was spared from the carnage, analysts are questioning whether its $65 billion AI spending spree is visionary or just bloated. Microsoft, already struggling to monetize its AI push, now faces growing pressure to prove that its massive capital outlays will pay off.

**AI Dreams vs. Investor Reality:** Both tech giants are betting their futures on AI, but execution is everything. Meta is using AI to supercharge its ad business and roll out new consumer-facing tools, while Microsoft’s AI dominance hinges on fixing its cloud supply crunch. With investors growing impatient for returns, the real question is whether these AI moonshots will turn into sustainable profits—or just expensive hype.

# 

# Fed Hits the Pause Button

Fed Chair Jerome Powell made it clear: interest rates aren’t going anywhere—for now. While traders were itching for a March rate cut, Powell’s message was more “let’s wait and see” than “get ready for liftoff.” The Fed wants proof inflation is truly under control before it starts easing, with Powell repeating (more than once) that policymakers need to see “serial readings” of cooling prices. Translation? The Fed isn’t convinced yet, and rate cuts might not come until June or later.

**Trump vs. Powell: Round Two?**  
  
If you thought Trump and the Fed’s rocky relationship ended in 2020, think again. The former—and now current—president wasted no time slamming Powell on Truth Social, blaming him for past inflation woes and making it clear he wants rates slashed ASAP. Powell, unfazed, reiterated that the Fed’s decisions are driven by data, not presidential tweets.

**Markets Take a Step Back**  
  
Investors weren’t thrilled. Stocks dipped, Treasury yields popped, and futures traders quickly adjusted expectations, pushing back bets on the first rate cut to June instead of March. While Powell didn’t slam the door on cuts this year, he also didn’t give the markets the green light they were hoping for. With inflation still hovering above the Fed’s 2% target and the economy chugging along, Powell isn’t in a rush to make moves.

**Looking Ahead:** The next big test? Inflation data in the coming months. If price pressures keep cooling, the Fed might start cutting sooner. But if Trump’s policies stir up inflationary headaches, Powell could be forced to keep rates higher for longer. Either way, expect more market drama as the Fed and the White House navigate what’s shaping up to be a bumpy economic ride.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Thursday’s data drop is packed with fresh reads on the economy, including jobless claims, pending home sales, and an early look at Q1 GDP. Investors will be watching closely to see if the labor market and housing sector are holding up or showing signs of strain.

On the earnings front, another wave of corporate heavyweights is set to report. Visa ($V), Mastercard ($MA), Caterpillar ($CAT), Intel ($INTC), Shell ($SHEL), Altria Group ($MO), Thermo Fisher Scientific ($TMO), Blackstone ($BX), Cigna ($CI), Southwest Airlines ($LUV), and Nokia ($NOK) will all reveal their latest numbers, giving Wall Street plenty to chew on.

# Before Market Open:

* **UPS** is often seen as a pulse check for consumer demand, but lately, that pulse has been weaker than expected. The stock has tumbled over 14% in the past year as revenue growth slowed and profit margins took a hit. Still, investors are banking on a rebound, with automation improvements and a strong holiday shipping season potentially lifting results. Wall Street will be watching whether UPS can deliver on expectations. Consensus: $2.53 EPS, $25.41 billion in revenue. ($UPS)

# After Market Close:

* **Apple** is in damage control mode. Another day, another analyst downgrade— this time from Oppenheimer, citing weak iPhone sales in China. Between a lukewarm Vision Pro launch, skepticism around Apple Intelligence, and Warren Buffett offloading shares, the company is under pressure to prove it still has its magic. Investors need to hear a clear 2025 strategy, or this earnings call could spark more selling. Consensus: $2.35 EPS, $124.4 billion in revenue. ($AAPL)",2025-01-30 02:05:44,1,0,Daytrading

DEEPSEEK:

* OPENAI accuses China's deepseek of using its model for Training:
* OpenAI has found evidence that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train its own open-source model, according to the Financial Times.
* The company says it detected signs of ""distillation""—a technique where developers use outputs from larger models to improve smaller ones, allowing them to achieve similar results at a lower cost.
* OpenAI declined to provide further details but emphasized that its terms prohibit copying its services or using outputs to develop competing models.
* U.S. Navy bans use of DeepSeek due to ‘security and ethical concerns
* Semianalysis, who are one of the best at semiconductor research IMO, corroborate that Deepseek had 10s of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, spending over $500M
* ASML on Deepseek: 
* “For AI to be everywhere, we need to see major progress on costs and power consumption. Lowering costs also leads to more volume...So I will say any technology, whatever it is, that will contribute to cost reduction will increase the opportunity.”

  
Main things to watch in the market:

* Right now, the key thing to watch is the CAPEX number for META and MSFT when they announce earnings tomorrow. If it is massively down from expectations, this will be seen as another selling trigger. Capex guidance in line will be seen as a reiteration that these firms are not massively concerned and will lead to a rip in semiconductors. The 2nd scenario is my base case.

MAG7:

* AAPL - Apple (AAPL) has been in secret cooperation with SpaceX and T-Mobile (TMUS) to support the Starlink satellite service in its latest iPhone operating system, which would serve as an alternative to Apple's current in-house satellite communication service, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports, citing people familiar with the matter.
* AAPL - Oppenheimer downgrades AAPL to perform from outperform, lowers FY26 EPS estimate by 4% to $7.95, below consensus of $8.23. Our revision is based on reduced estimates for iPhone sales over the next 12-18 months. Said main headwinds for the company are stronger competition in China, and lack of compelling AI features
* META - CEO Mark Zuckerberg is exploring the purchase of a property in Washington, D.C., according to sources cited by the Financial Times. Notable in implying improved relationship with president. 
* NVDA - Ming Chi Kuo, one of the top semiconductor analysts, says that While scaling laws are hitting limits, Nvidia remains the dominant player. Kuo suggests its edge will grow when scaling laws regain momentum, but short-term supply chain issues with the GB200 NVL72 could impact expectations.

# Starbucks Brews Up a Turnaround

Starbucks may still be nursing a hangover from its tough 2024, but there’s a glimmer of caffeine-fueled hope. The coffee giant reported a 4% drop in same-store sales for Q1, a smaller decline than Wall Street’s 5.5% expectation and a notable improvement from the previous quarter's 7% slide. Investors were perked up, sending shares up 3% in after-hours trading.

**Reigniting the Roast**  
  
CEO Brian Niccol, just five months into his tenure, has been steaming ahead with his “Back to Starbucks” strategy. From nixing the nondairy milk upcharge to revamping condiment bars and rolling out cozy, customer-centric policies, the company is doubling down on improving the in-store experience. Niccol has even brought in former Taco Bell colleagues to help brew a smoother operational blend.

But it’s not all lattes and smiles yet. Traffic to U.S. stores dropped 8%, and China—a key market—saw same-store sales fall 6% as Starbucks leaned into discounts to compete with budget-friendly rivals like Luckin Coffee.

**Profit vs. Progress**  
  
Starbucks posted $9.4 billion in revenue for the quarter, flat year-over-year but ahead of estimates. Earnings per share hit $0.69, also topping expectations. However, net income took a 23% hit, reflecting investments in Niccol’s turnaround plan and wage hikes for baristas. Operating margins were pinched, but analysts remain optimistic about the long-term payoff.

**A Latte on the Line**  
  
The chain’s overhaul extends beyond the café counter. Starbucks plans to scale back new store openings and renovations in 2025, redirecting funds to fuel its comeback efforts. Layoffs are also on the horizon as the company reshapes its corporate structure for clearer accountability.

Niccol’s bold moves—and Wall Street’s vote of confidence—suggest the turnaround might just have the steam to deliver. For now, Starbucks is walking the fine line between brewing better customer experiences and balancing profitability.

# Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic Gets Green Light for Kidney Disease Treatment

Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster drug, Ozempic, just expanded its resume. The FDA approved the GLP-1 injection to treat chronic kidney disease in adults with Type 2 diabetes, offering a lifeline for millions battling progressive kidney failure and related cardiovascular risks.

**A Lifesaver in a Syringe**  
  
Ozempic has already been a game-changer for diabetes and weight loss, but this approval takes it further. The drug slashed the risk of severe kidney outcomes—think kidney failure or death—from 24% to 29% in trials. For a condition affecting 37 million Americans, that’s huge. Novo’s Chief Medical Officer Stephen Gough called it a breakthrough in addressing diseases that “cluster within the same individuals,” targeting diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, and cardiovascular conditions with a single injection.

**A Competitive Landscape**  
  
This FDA nod strengthens Ozempic’s position as the most broadly approved GLP-1 drug. Novo now faces increased rivalry from Eli Lilly, whose own GLP-1 drugs are making waves, but with this approval, Novo aims to maintain its lead. The decision could also shake up the dialysis market, echoing the phase-three trial’s results that caused kidney dialysis stocks to plummet last year.

**Beyond the Injection:** Ozempic’s approval marks another win for GLP-1 drugs, which are proving their value beyond diabetes. The broader implications—like reducing cardiovascular and kidney risks—could reshape treatment strategies and encourage expanded insurance coverage.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The Federal Reserve kicks off its first meeting of the year, with inflation and interest rates taking center stage. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver the verdict tomorrow, and while markets are watching closely, there’s little expectation of a rate cut—current odds stand at a slim 0.5%.  
  
Tomorrow’s after-hours session will bring updates from three tech heavyweights: Tesla, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. Their numbers are poised to offer fresh insights into how the sector is navigating a volatile market landscape as 2025 gets rolling.

# Before Market Open: 

* The first chipmaker to report earnings since DeepSeek’s AI bombshell, **ASML Holding** has some explaining to do. With analysts eager for updates on capital spending, the real spotlight will be on how tariffs and geopolitical tension are squeezing the company’s margins. Shares have been under pressure, but Wall Street remains optimistic with every analyst covering the stock issuing a “buy” rating. Consensus expectations sit at $6.71 EPS and $9.02 billion in revenue. ($ASML)

# After Market Close: 

* **IBM** may have roots in legacy tech, but it’s been steadily planting seeds in AI, cloud computing, and quantum technology. These forward-looking investments make the company more than just a relic of tech’s past, even if its pace of innovation is deliberate. Add to that a stable dividend that offers a cushion for patient investors, and IBM is quietly making its case as a long-term play. Analysts anticipate $3.79 EPS on $17.6 billion in revenue this quarter. ($IBM)

Portfolios that profited on one of the worst market days of the last 2 years,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1ic3zn8/portfolios_that_profited_on_one_of_the_worst/,"Yesterday was one of *those* days. Nvidia lost the value of Argentina’s economy in market cap (ouch), energy stocks tanked, and semiconductors followed Nvidia into the abyss. The NASDAQ dropped \~3%, which isn’t great if you’re holding heavy tech positions.

But here’s the twist: not everyone got crushed. While most portfolios on our platform (85%, to be exact) took a hit yesterday, *15% were up.* Let’s break down what worked for those portfolios and what short-term traders might learn from the chaos:

**What worked yesterday:**

* **Consumer Goods, Healthcare, and Financial Services stocks** led the charge. Some portfolios in these sectors gained 3-5% yesterday alone, proving there’s always action somewhere if you know where to look.
* **“Buy the dip” strategies** pulled through. Traders who snagged companies that had already taken a beating (and avoided chasing tech at its highs) sidestepped much of yesterday’s carnage and caught rebounds instead.

**Key takeaway:** It’s not just about riding the hot hand; it’s about timing your entries and avoiding sectors in freefall. A well-diversified playbook can keep you nimble when markets turn.

For all the hype around tech (NVDA fans, I see you), the *real* money is moving in unexpected places. Let’s talk short-term moves in **2024 performance highlights across industries**:

* **Energy:** GE Vernova up almost 200%
* **Banking:** JPMorgan up 40%+
* **Retail:** Sprouts Farmers Market up 207%
* **Airlines:** United Airlines up 147%+
* **Construction & Industrials:** United States Lime & Minerals up 120%+
* **Healthcare:** Alignment Healthcare up 121%

These aren’t just long-term plays—many of these moves came after sharp corrections or during short-term catalysts. The trick? Catching momentum *before* the herd piles in.

**What to watch next:**

* After a bloodbath like yesterday, watch for oversold bounces (RSI < 30 might be your friend here).
* Keep an eye on sectors like healthcare and consumer goods that showed strength while tech stumbled. Momentum traders may start rotating here.
* News catalysts are king: Earnings season just started, and one good or bad report can shift the entire vibe of a sector.

The bottom line: even when the broader market tanks, there’s always a trade. Whether you’re scalping intraday moves or holding swing positions for a few days, staying flexible and watching for sector rotations can make all the difference.

What were your best (or worst) trades yesterday? Let’s hear it.

Happy trading!",2025-01-28 15:24:31,1,0,Daytrading

# DeepSeek Just Pulled a Fast One on Silicon Valley

What happens when a scrappy startup from China pulls off a David-vs.-Goliath upset? U.S. tech stocks lose a cool $1 trillion, and Nvidia logs the biggest single-day market cap wipeout in history. Enter DeepSeek, the new kid on the AI block, proving you don’t need billion-dollar budgets or cutting-edge chips to shake up the industry.

**AI’s New MVP**  
  
DeepSeek’s latest AI model, R1, developed in just two months for under $6 million, is outperforming its American counterparts in benchmarks. Even more jaw-dropping? The startup used Nvidia’s less-powerful H800 chips—ones deemed “safe” by U.S. export controls. Their secret? An open-source strategy and efficient training methods that make Meta, OpenAI, and Google look like big spenders at an overhyped auction.

**The Fallout**  
  
Nvidia plummeted 17%, losing $589 billion in market cap. Microsoft, Meta, and other tech darlings also tumbled. The Nasdaq 100 sank 3%—its worst drop in six weeks—while energy and infrastructure stocks tied to AI, like Constellation Energy, saw double-digit losses. But some, like Salesforce, could benefit if DeepSeek’s approach makes AI cheaper for end users.

**The Bigger Question**  
  
DeepSeek isn’t just a shock to valuations; it’s a wake-up call for Silicon Valley. With China proving it can play the AI game on a shoestring budget, the days of unquestioned U.S. dominance may be numbered. Nvidia, Meta, and others might want to rethink their big-spending strategies, especially as investors start asking whether the AI boom has gone a little too... bubbly.

**What’s Next?** DeepSeek’s success could rewire the AI race, challenging the notion that throwing money at problems equals better results. But don’t count U.S. tech out yet—earnings reports from Nvidia, Microsoft, and others this week will reveal whether they’ve got what it takes to weather the storm. For now, though, DeepSeek has reminded the giants that every disruptor starts somewhere.

# Fed Faces 2025 with Rates on Lock

The Federal Reserve kicks off its first meeting of 2025 this week, and despite Trump’s not-so-subtle nudging, don’t hold your breath for any rate cuts. Jerome Powell and his crew are expected to keep the key rate at 4.3%, marking a cautious pause after last year’s three consecutive reductions.

**Why the Pause?**  
  
Inflation is cooling—but not enough. Prices are hovering at 2.4%, just above the Fed’s 2% sweet spot, and the job market remains stubbornly strong, with unemployment at a low 4.1%. For Powell, the challenge is threading the needle: holding rates high enough to keep inflation in check without tipping the economy into a recession. With Trump’s proposed tariffs lurking in the background, inflation risks aren’t exactly taking a back seat.

**Trump vs. The Fed: The Rematch**  
  
Trump has made it clear he’s not a fan of waiting. Last week at Davos, he said he’d “demand” lower rates, calling out Powell by name (again) and claiming he knows interest rates “better than they do.” For now, Powell isn’t taking the bait, but the tension between 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and the Marriner S. Eccles Building is palpable.

**The Stakes**  
  
Fed officials are divided. Some, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, think inflation will keep easing, justifying future cuts. Others, like Cleveland’s Beth Hammack, argue that the Fed needs to keep rates elevated to fight stubborn price pressures. Add Trump’s tariffs and potential labor market disruptions into the mix, and it’s a recipe for uncertainty.

**What’s Next?** The Fed is signaling a cautious approach, with a “wait and see” stance likely to dominate this week. But don’t expect Trump to stay quiet—he’s already hinted at future clashes with Powell, whose term runs until 2026. Whether rates hold, drop, or—brace yourself—rise, the stage is set for a high-stakes game of monetary policy tug-of-war.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s lineup is stacked with economic updates: the consumer confidence index, the S&P Case-Shiller home price index, and durable goods orders are all on deck. Plus, the Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day FOMC meeting. While we’ll have to wait until Wednesday for any rate decision, expect plenty of chatter about what Jerome Powell and team are cooking up.

Earnings season stays busy with names like Boeing ($BA), Lockheed Martin ($LMT), General Motors ($GM), Royal Caribbean ($RCL), Kimberly-Clark ($KMB), and Chubb ($CB) taking the stage. JetBlue Airways ($JBLU) will test the airline sector’s hot streak, while Starbucks ($SBUX) looks to reverse three straight quarters of declining sales under its new CEO. Shareholders in both will be watching closely to see if they can deliver—or disappoint.

# Before Market Open:

* **JetBlue Airways** ($JBLU) is flying into turbulence ahead of its earnings report. Despite a banner earnings season for airlines, analysts aren’t feeling optimistic—six say “hold” and four say “sell.” The skepticism centers on JetBlue’s towering debt-to-equity ratio, dwindling cash flow, and mounting operating losses. Investors are crossing their fingers that robust consumer demand and the broader industry’s momentum can carry the airline higher. Expectations are set at -$0.31 EPS on $2.26 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **Starbucks** ($SBUX) is brewing more than coffee—it’s trying to find its identity under CEO Brian Niccol. With three consecutive quarters of declining sales and sliding customer transactions, shareholders are banking on Niccol to deliver a turnaround. The chain is grappling with balancing its corporate behemoth status with its neighborhood-friendly vibe. Anything short of a rebound could send the stock steeply lower. Analysts are eyeing $0.68 EPS on $9.32 billion in revenue.",2025-01-28 00:06:17,1,0,Daytrading

Down 18K! On one trade,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1i9irk6/down_18k_on_one_trade/,"I’m relatively new to the market(6 months) and I’ve been trading Nvidia for the last week or two I thought I had the charts all figured out(me, the expert lol). I would wake up and make 1-2k a day and life was great. So on Friday I took Nvidia calls, almost positive I could replicate my success. I took 80 contracts with almost 80% of my available trading balance. All was going well, I had the opportunity to sell, making 3k for the day. It would have been my biggest win to date. But then I thought….what if I could make more?! And then pain and delusion ensued. The candles befsn began to plummet faster than I’d ever seen. I thought “this isn’t normally how I’ve seen the price behave” but then I also thought “How good would it feel to finish Friday on a win”. I never exited because I was so sure there’d be a bounce. Surely I couldn’t be wrong. I was down to a 50% loss and still my stupidity reigned supreme. I stared at the charts blankly and amazed the way a child stares at the screen when they first discover Roblox or bluey. Price continued to drop, right below the 145 level, a level I thought provided the utmost support. Still I HELD! What a bargain, surely we’ll see a rally at the end of the day I thought. I’m already down 50% maybe i can get a slight movement and sell for only a 20% loss”. 

Looking back I can’t believe I let myself get so greedy. I only have 3k left to trade with now. People have certainly come back from worse but, I really can’t believe my money is gone just like that.  

I’m writing this out in the hopes that 6-9 months from now I can revisit this post and look back at how I’ve grown as a trader. And hopefully it resonates with someone else who’s been here.  And if you happen to be here in the same position if you take anything from my loss, take these three points:  1. You can’t trade like a dumbass and be surprised when you get dumbass results and 2. It’s a painful lesson but It’s not totally the end of the world. 3. It doesn’t matter how good your strategy is if you don’t stick to it.

# 

# Big Earnings Day: American Airlines, EA, & SK Hynix

**American Airlines: Turbulence Ahead**  
  
American Airlines warned of a Q1 loss between $0.20-$0.40 per share, stunning a market expecting a small profit. Non-fuel costs are rising, fueled by labor contracts and a regional fleet expansion. The fallout from a misfired business travel strategy still lingers, even as revenue forecasts remain upbeat, with full-year growth projected at 3%-7.5%. Shares nosedived 9%, but American’s trans-Pacific routes and $590 million in Q4 profit offered some hope. ($AAL)

**EA: Games Fall Short**  
  
EA’s holiday lineup disappointed, driving its stock down 16.7%—its worst drop since 2008. Flagship *EA Sports FC 2025*underperformed, while *Dragon Age: The Veilguard* missed expectations by 50%, hitting just 1.5 million players. Bookings fell short at $2.22 billion, and the company cut FY25 guidance to $7.0-$7.15 billion, down from $7.5-$7.8 billion. EA is now banking on a FY26 rebound, but for now, the gamers aren’t biting.

**SK Hynix: AI Boost, Stock Blues**  
  
SK Hynix shattered records with a 2,236% surge in Q4 operating profit to 8.08 trillion won ($5.6 billion), fueled by booming demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips—the tech Nvidia loves for AI. HBM accounted for 40% of DRAM sales, and the company expects those sales to double this year. Yet, investors weren’t sold. Shares slipped initially but rose 2.28%, thanks to concerns over cooling AI spending and modest capex plans. (000660.KS, $KOREAN EXCHANGE)

**The Bottom Line:**  
  
A record-breaking chipmaker, a struggling airline, and a gaming giant all walk into earnings season...and none emerge unscathed. AI and travel might be soaring, but challenges like uncertain demand and unsteady consumer trends are proving that no sector is bulletproof.

# Trump Takes Center Stage At Davos World Economic Forum:  Oil, Interest Rates, and Tariffs

President Trump didn’t hold back during his virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, hitting all the high notes of his “America First” symphony. With global CEOs watching, he laid out a wishlist that included lower oil prices, interest rate cuts, and hefty tariffs for businesses operating outside the U.S.

**Oil Prices: The OPEC Ultimatum**  
  
Trump called on OPEC and Saudi Arabia to drop oil prices, tying the move to ending the Russia-Ukraine war. His logic? Cheap oil would drain Russian revenues and force a ceasefire. Markets reacted immediately, with crude oil prices falling 1.62%. But convincing OPEC—keen on keeping prices high—might be a tougher sell than Trump anticipates.

**Interest Rates: Turning Up the Heat on the Fed**  
  
Taking his critique of the Federal Reserve up a notch, Trump demanded immediate rate cuts, claiming high interest rates were stifling growth. While central banks traditionally steer clear of political interference, Trump’s blunt remarks underscored his ongoing tension with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who might need a thicker skin for round two of Trump’s presidency.

**Tariff Talk: Allies Beware**  
  
European regulators didn’t escape Trump’s crosshairs either. He threatened new tariffs on foreign goods, pitching it as a way to funnel “hundreds of billions” into U.S. coffers. His message to global businesses? “Make it in America or pay the price.” While allies bristled, Trump’s rhetoric resonated with those eager for a manufacturing revival.

**Big Picture: Bold Claims, Big Stakes**  
  
Trump painted an ambitious vision for the U.S. as a manufacturing superpower, AI hub, and energy giant. But with tariffs, sanctions, and sweeping policy changes on the table, global leaders face a choice: adapt to Trump’s economic playbook or brace for impact. For now, markets—and world leaders—are left wondering what’s next in Trump’s unfiltered economic strategy.

# TikTok’s Fate Rests on Trump After Supreme Court Upholds Law

The Supreme Court has spoken: TikTok’s U.S. operations are officially on the chopping block unless ByteDance divests ownership by Sunday. The verdict sends shockwaves through the digital sphere, with TikTok's 170 million American users now scrambling for alternatives—and rival platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat hoping to cash in.

But wait, it’s complicated. Incoming President Trump, a known TikTok fan (go figure), might throw a lifeline. Rumors swirl of an executive order delaying the ban, while ByteDance plays hardball, showing no interest in selling the platform.

**Winners, Losers, and... RedNote?**

**Winners**: Meta and Google, potentially. Instagram and YouTube could see user numbers surge, but there’s no guarantee TikTok creators will flock to their turf. Instead, Chinese app RedNote has been stealing the spotlight, topping the App Store as frustrated TikTokers seek refuge.

**Losers**: ByteDance, which faces a $40-$50 billion price tag to offload TikTok. Also in the hot seat: Apple and Google, tasked with enforcing the ban on their app stores unless Trump changes the playbook.

**What’s Next?**

If TikTok pulls the plug, users could face a complete shutdown or buggy app chaos as updates cease. Trump’s administration might offer a 90-day extension for ByteDance to strike a deal, with whispers of Elon Musk or U.S. investors as potential buyers. Meanwhile, creators are hedging their bets, directing followers to rival platforms.

As the saga unfolds, one thing’s clear: the battle over TikTok is far from just about viral dances—it’s a high-stakes chess game of geopolitics, national security, and big tech dominance.

# Airbnb’s ramping up lobbying to reverse NYC’s restrictions on short-term rentals

Airbnb is doubling down on its fight against New York City’s strict short-term rental rules, dropping $5 million to back pro-home-sharing politicians. The 2023 rules—requiring hosts to live onsite during rentals and limiting guests to two—slashed 80% of Airbnb’s NYC listings, dealing a hefty blow to its bottom line.

**Lobbying Wars**

The short-term rental giant isn’t new to political spending, but its recent lobbying spree in New York has already outpaced the previous five years combined. Airbnb is funding advocacy groups like RHOAR (Restore Homeowner Autonomy and Rights), while critics accuse it of creating ""astroturf"" movements disguised as grassroots campaigns.

The company’s wishlist? A law allowing single- and two-family homeowners to rent out properties without being onsite, upping the guest limit to four, and letting hosts lock doors inside rentals.

**Hotels Are Winning—for Now**

Since the crackdown, average NYC hotel rates have hit $417/night—a record high. Meanwhile, Airbnb argues the restrictions aren’t solving the housing crisis, pointing to rising rents and fewer affordable travel options.

Airbnb isn’t just battling NYC; it’s fighting similar rental crackdowns worldwide, including Barcelona’s planned 2029 short-term rental ban. As regulations tighten, the company is ramping up its political game, framing its efforts as empowering homeowners and supporting local economies.

**What’s Next?** While NYC accounts for just 1% of Airbnb’s revenue, the symbolic win could influence how other cities regulate short-term rentals. The company’s message is clear: It’s willing to pay to play—and to keep the Big Apple’s home-sharing market alive.

# Hindenburg’s Final Descent

Nate Anderson, the audacious mastermind behind Hindenburg Research, has officially closed the chapter on his polarizing short-selling firm. For the past eight years, Hindenburg has been Wall Street's nightmare machine, targeting billionaires, top corporations, and even the occasional retail darling. But now, Anderson’s calling it quits, leaving behind a legacy that’s equal parts controversial and consequential.

Hindenburg’s list of targets reads like a who's who of corporate heavyweights: Carl Icahn, Gautam Adani, and Jack Dorsey all found themselves in the crosshairs. The firm’s research wiped out billions in market value—$170 billion to be exact—and set the stage for multiple fraud investigations. Adani alone saw $99 billion shaved off his net worth after Anderson accused him of orchestrating “the largest con in corporate history.” And let’s not forget Nikola, where Hindenburg’s revelations about staged videos and false claims landed the EV startup’s founder, Trevor Milton, a prison sentence.

# So, Why Shut Down?

Anderson says it wasn’t lawsuits, losses, or burnout. Instead, it’s about reclaiming time and sanity. “Hindenburg was a chapter, not the book,” Anderson explained in a letter. Translation: he’s stepping off the rollercoaster of short-selling warfare to focus on family, hobbies, and investments that don’t require combing through financial statements for fraud.

The firm’s exit strategy wasn’t abrupt—it wrapped up its latest investigations, including one into Carvana that the auto retailer vehemently dismissed. Anderson plans to release educational resources to train future skeptics in the art of activist short-selling. Think of it as Hindenburg’s “How to Catch a Fraud” masterclass.

# What’s Next?

For Anderson, the future looks a lot calmer: index funds, quality time with loved ones, and a step away from the spotlight. But for Wall Street, it’s the end of an era. Hindenburg wasn’t just a short-selling firm; it was a thorn in the side of corporate giants, a watchdog that often outmaneuvered regulators, and a reminder that no empire is untouchable.

As Anderson winds down, the question remains: Who will fill the void? For now, Wall Street’s worst-kept secret is officially off the grid—and corporate boardrooms are breathing a little easier.

# Amex to Pay $230 Million Over Misleading Sales Practices

American Express is shelling out $230 million to settle a years-long investigation into misleading sales practices targeting small-business customers. The penalties, split between federal prosecutors and the Federal Reserve, come after allegations that Amex marketed products with tax-saving benefits that didn’t exactly hold up under scrutiny.

From 2018 to 2019, Amex pushed wire services like Premium Wire and Payroll Rewards, claiming they offered tax deductions and tax-free Membership Reward points. Spoiler: they didn’t. The DOJ said the fees weren’t “ordinary” or “necessary” business expenses, making those tax benefits invalid. After an internal review in 2021, Amex canned the products and fired about 200 employees tied to the scandal.

**Beyond the Wire**

Amex’s troubles didn’t stop there. Between 2014 and 2017, the company allegedly misled small-business owners about credit card rewards, fees, and credit checks. Some sales reps even used fake employer identification numbers (like the oh-so-subtle “123456788”) to boost applications during a high-pressure campaign to retain customers after Costco ditched Amex for Citi in 2016.

While Amex denied liability for certain practices, this isn’t its first regulatory run-in. The company paid $15 million in 2023 to settle related claims with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Still, this latest round of settlements includes a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ and an agreement-in-principle with the Federal Reserve.

**Damage Control Mode**

Amex says it’s taken steps to clean house, including disciplining employees, overhauling training programs, and beefing up compliance. The company also stressed that the $230 million penalty won’t dent its 2024 financial guidance, as most of the costs were accounted for in earlier periods.

While this marks a resolution to one chapter, the broader message from regulators is loud and clear: when trust is broken, the fines will follow. As for Amex, it’s back to business—hopefully, with fewer dummy numbers this time.

# Meta to Cut Roughly 5% of Staff, Targeting Lowest Performers

In a move that feels like déjà vu, Meta announced it’s cutting about 5% of its workforce—or around 3,600 jobs—by February. But this round of cuts isn’t about reducing costs—it’s about raising the performance bar. In a memo to employees, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wants to “move out low performers faster” and focus on assembling the best talent as Meta gears up for an “intense year” of building in AI, smart glasses, and the future of social media.

**A Balancing Act**

While some roles are being slashed, new ones are being created. Meta plans to backfill these positions later this year, signaling that the company is doubling down on key growth areas. However, Wall Street didn’t exactly cheer—shares fell more than 2% after the announcement.

The memo also comes on the heels of other major changes, including the end of Meta’s fact-checking program and a rollback of diversity efforts, moves that some see as attempts to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration.

**Raising Eyebrows**

Zuckerberg’s efficiency push has sparked internal debate, with some employees questioning whether these cuts disproportionately affect underrepresented groups—especially after recent comments about fostering more ""masculine energy"" in corporate culture. And while Meta says the focus is on boosting performance, critics argue the policy shifts could further erode trust among its workforce, particularly in areas tied to inclusion and oversight.

**The Bigger Picture**

Zuckerberg’s focus on efficiency isn’t new—he dubbed 2023 as Meta’s ""year of efficiency"" and cut over 20,000 roles across the company. Now, he’s positioning Meta to stay competitive as it pivots toward AI-led growth. But this time, the cuts have reignited concerns about whether Meta can pull off this balancing act without losing its edge—or its people.

# Intel to Turn Venture Arm Into Separate Firm With New Name

Intel is spinning off its venture capital arm, Intel Capital, into an independent investment fund, aiming to inject new energy (and new money) into its operations. Intel, which will stay on as an anchor investor, says the standalone fund will start operating under a new name in the second half of 2025, boasting over $5 billion in assets under management.

The move is all about flexibility. By stepping out of Intel’s shadow, Intel Capital can raise funds from external backers while continuing to make strategic bets on innovative startups. The current Intel Capital team will transition to the new entity, and day-to-day operations will carry on without interruption. Interim co-CEO David Zinsner called the split a ""win-win"" that unlocks new capital while keeping Intel’s strategic partnership intact.

**A Legacy of Bold Bets**

Intel Capital, established in 1991, was a pioneer in corporate venture capital. Over the years, it has invested more than $20 billion in over 1,800 companies, with a portfolio spanning AI, cloud, 5G, and robotics. Its big-name bets include AI chipmaker SambaNova and robotics firm Figure, proving that it knows how to pick winners in the tech game.

But this spinoff isn’t happening in a vacuum. Intel has faced significant headwinds, reporting a record $16.6 billion quarterly loss last year—the largest in its history. To turn things around, the company launched a $10 billion cost-cutting plan that included shedding 15,000 jobs and spinning off other divisions like its FPGA business, Altera.

**The Bigger Picture**

While Intel Capital’s newfound independence mirrors similar moves in Silicon Valley (think SAP’s Sapphire Ventures), it underscores Intel’s broader effort to regain its footing amid fierce competition. As Nvidia and AMD dominate the chip scene, Intel’s restructuring is a bet on long-term survival and reinvention.

For Intel Capital, this next chapter presents an opportunity to expand its venture portfolio while navigating the complex landscape of global tech. Meanwhile, Intel’s future depends on whether it can turn its renewed focus on cutting-edge chipmaking into a comeback story worth watching.

Trading and surfing: 5 steps to building your ideal setup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1i1evbk/trading_and_surfing_5_steps_to_building_your/,"Hi all,

I'm a husband and dad of five and I've recently transitioned to full time trading.

I wanted to post some concepts that I've found helpful in my trading journey, and in doing so maybe help someone who's thinking of, or working on transitioning to full time trading.

Writing out these concepts has been really helpful for teaching myself different nuances in trading and since I was doing it anyway I thought I'd post it here to potentially help others.

Would also love feedback on my concepts and ideas and to hear about how you guys find the right ""conditions"" for your trading setups.

Here's my post:  
(These are basically notes to myself)

What is a trading “Setup”?

To me, a setup is a set of clear conditions needed to enter and exit a trade.

And to help understand these concepts, I like look at them through the lens of surfing.

Here’s what I mean; Surfers need certain conditions to be met in order to enter the water, paddle out, and consistently catch waves.

Conditions like location of the body of water, time of year, and daily weather patterns all play a part. They also need to consider if the surf spot is crowded, what type of waves they’re trying to catch based on the season, where they will start their wave, and where they’ll exit. They also need to ensure there are safety measures in place.

When combined, these conditions determine the surfers chance of success.

After thousands of attempts that surfer will have a very good understanding of the conditions needed to consistently catch waves. And he will be very specific about those conditions being met in the future, to ensure consistency.

Trading is no different.

# Make it your own.

It’s become clear to me that to be successful over time, every trader must build out their own specific trading conditions that need to be met (trade setups) in order to find trading’s holy grail: consistency.

It’s easy to think setups are best copied from your favorite trader—and yes, this is often a good foundation—but consider a quote from one of my favorite trading authors:

""What if we simply focused on what we understand, what we do well, what makes sense to us?"" – Mike Bellafiore

This makes a lot of sense to me because you are a unique person, with certain traits, talents and abilities. You have individual likes, dislikes, goals, desires, and curiosities.

Just as every surfer is unique, so is every trader. You must eventually carve you’re own path.

I started to get super curious about large and mid-caps on the Nasdaq after I came across traders like Steve Spencer and SMB Capital.

Steve shares examples of how to take advantage of intraday moves in these liquid leaders and I wanted to find more examples—to see how and why people are doing this—so I turned to twitter(X). I questioned and observed how people are thinking about setups in this sector.

The volume and variety of ways people trade is mind-blowing. A clear pattern emerged: each trader developed their own set of conditions through countless trade attempts (reps), staying persistent and learning from their mistakes - making small tweaks along the way with each lesson learned.

“There are no silver bullets, only golden bibi’s” - Unknown

Over time I came to realize this sector of the market was a good place for me to start for several reasons:

1. The (mostly) absent fat-tail risk found in small-cap stocks.
2. The liquidity available to get in and out easily.
3. The variety of ways to leverage trades through things like leveraged ETFs and options.
4. The consistency of moves and catalysts that come from these particular stocks, making them easier to catalogue.
5. Scalability over time.

To help you explore this yourself, I’ll explain five common principles to help you find your conditions. I do this to remind myself and to hopefully support you in building your own setups (conditions) to find consistency.

As you read this post, I encourage you to think about a sector or financial product that has peaked your interest for one reason or another, and what conditions might be needed to suit your needs.

# 5 Principles to creating your own setups

# 1. Narrow your focus - be specific. (What body of water will you surf?)

One common theme I see in all successful traders is being in the right stocks at the right time, and being very specific about it.

A common saying amongst traders - “You’re only as good as the stocks you trade”

Let me explain using the surfing analogy again:  
(I’ll be doing that a lot in this post)

”You’re only as good as the waves you surf”

From careful observation over time, surfers know that the best waves typically happen in Hawaii. Specifically on the north shore of Hawaii.

And just like the surfer, not every trade is worth “paddling out” for. Your job is to find the conditions (a location) where the stocks are moving well and most suited to your abilities. Being in the right place at the right time is everything. Think about it, if you don’t have waves to surf you end up swimming in circles. Trading is no different.

In trading this could be narrowing your focus to large caps with at least a $10 billion market cap and trading at least 1 million shares premarket, and trading them at the open of the trading day when there is the most volume. Or you could look at small cap stocks that have gapped at least 20%. Personally, I like large and mid cap stocks that are trading at least 2-3 times their normal volume in the premarket.

Wherever you focus, the principle is this:

Just like the surfer, you must find a very specific location or sector of the market that is known to consistently produce great trades (waves).

# 2. Stocks are like elastic bands (Are we in the right season for surfing?)

Now that we have our first condition - location - we need to find our specific time frame when the “waves” are at their best.

For surfers, November to February is the prime surfing season in Hawaii.  
It’s when the ocean is most “out of balance” and producing the best waves.

Stocks need to rebalance and find equilibrium, just like the ocean.  
We can often see this imbalance when looking at the price chart (I personally like to start with the daily chart in my search).

The more stretched or compressed a stock is, combined with the amount of time it remains in that state, the greater the probability of an outsized move is coming (wave to surf).

Just as surfers recognize certain patterns in the seasons, traders start to recognize patterns in the price charts that show them when a stock is out of balance and whether it’s in the right “season” for trading.

Check out the example below. Here’s a stock that looks out of balance to me and that I think was ready for a wave:

https://preview.redd.it/viy39ybcl0de1.png?width=2551&format=png&auto=webp&s=de605743a8c4284c2a48bdd9346eda8ad4c3e0cf

Nvidia had been building pressure (compressed) for two months. Instead of heading back down, it paused mid-channel, making a “higher low” and started pushing up to the upper level of the trend. The pressure that was building released, and it broke out to the previous high from the candle on the far left. This change in price action (for me it was the higher low) signals it was time to get interested and dig a bit deeper.

Surf’s up!

# 3. Catalysts are key to finding consistency (What’s the weather like today?)

Think about the conditions we have so far:

1. Sector/stock (location)
2. Daily pattern (time of season)

For our third condition, we’re talking about catalysts (think weather on the day)...

In the case of a surfer, they’re observing if the day’s weather conditions match with the location and time of season. If they’re in Hawaii > on the north shore > in January > they know from hard-won experience that the perfect weather includes the following:

* Big Swells: January is part of Hawaii's peak surf season, with large swells generated by winter storms in the North Pacific. Wave heights typically range from 6-20+ feet, depending on the spot (e.g., Pipeline, Sunset Beach, or Waimea Bay).
* Clean Surf: Ideal conditions have minimal wind or light offshore winds (blowing from the land to the sea), which keep the waves clean and well-shaped.
* Swell Direction :A west-northwest to northwest swell direction is optimal for the North Shore, as it aligns well with most surf breaks.
* Mild Air Temperatures: Daytime highs: 75–80°F (24–27°C).Nighttime lows: Around 65–70°F (18–21°C).
* Sunny or Partly Cloudy Skies: Clear weather enhances visibility and comfort.
* Gentle Winds: Trade winds (northeast) are common but should be light to avoid choppy surf. Ideal wind speeds: 5–10 mph (8–16 km/h).
* Water Temperature: Around 75°F (24°C), so a light wetsuit top or rash guard is usually sufficient, but many surfers go without.
* Tide: Tide timing depends on the specific break, but mid to high tide is often preferred for safer and more consistent waves.

Think about how specific that is!  
Now let’s take that principle over to trading.

In the example of Nvidia, the main catalyst was technical (based mostly on the chart pattern). The stock’s daily price action had been compressed for a meaningful amount of time, it then started to deviate and move up on volume, to what I deemed as a very key level. Showing me it was potentially ready to change. This (along with a few other variables that are unique to my needs) confirmed it met my conditions for a potential trade on the day.

The “weather” looked good!

Catalysts can of course be non-technical. They can include fresh news, downgrades, upgrades, or surprise earnings reports. These can all be great reasons to enter a trade.

For example, if the market expects $1 per share in earnings, but the company delivers $1.20—especially from a new revenue stream—it can spark a powerful move.

For the surfer, the weather conditions need to match up with the location and season in order to create good waves.

For the trader, the best catalysts will nearly always match up with the first two conditions; location (stock) and time of season (daily pattern).

With thousands of reps, just as it becomes second nature to a seasoned surfer, the same is true for the experienced trader.

Tip: In the early stages of your trading career, just like a young surfer, be specific and write out every nuance you notice when you see big trades (waves). It could be things like what the volume is doing, what’s the sector doing, how it’s acting in the premarket or around certain key levels, what’s the open interest in the option chains, are there big buyers or sellers on the tape? etc. This gives you more data to cross reference over time and allows you to gain experience faster. Don’t forget to record your screen so you can replay the trades! Upload your recordings to YouTube and set them to private for easy reference.

# 4. Volume (Now we’re in the water, waiting for the wave)

We now have a very solid base of conditions to build on. So far our principles include:

1. Sector/stock (location)
2. Daily pattern (time of season)
3. Catalyst (weather conditions of the day).

Now let’s talk about the fourth principle: Volume (how many shares are being bought and sold in a certain time frame).

Volume flows give you a sense of the probabilities of the expected move actually taking place.

Again, think of it like a surfer waiting for the next wave; they might have perfect conditions on the day, they just need some confirmation…

They may see a rising bump or swell line on the horizon. This indicates an incoming wave. Surfers look for sets (groups of waves) and gauge the wave's size and speed from its appearance far out at sea.

Traders can do the same with volume!

For example: Is the volume increasing or slowing? Is it more than normal for this stock, sector, or time of day? By how much? Is it spiking or constant?

If the volume looks like it’s aligning with your conditions, it’s time to focus.

The wave is coming…

Now one last piece of the puzzle remains.

# 5. Price action (Wait for your signal to enter)

We’re in the water, waiting…Conditions are perfect.

We have our conditions set:

1. Stock (location) ✓
2. Daily pattern (time of season) ✓
3. Catalyst (weather on the day) ✓
4. Volume (water rises on the horizon) ✓

The final piece to the puzzle is price action…

You have a plan in place, you know what you want to see, you just need to wait to see it.

In trading, price action can include things like candlestick patterns, tape reading (one of my favorites), price behavior around certain key levels or indicators, bid and offer sizing on the level II, and many other nuances that simply take time and reps to recognize.

Price action is everything in trading.

It’s the final piece that tells you if it’s go time (or not).

I personally love it because feedback is almost instantaneous.  
Some traders call it the “only truth” in trading.

In surfing I liken it to when you see the white water at the tip of a wave starting to crest, the waves are starting to move faster and break to shore according your angle. This is exactly what you want to see - all signaling your entry.

Time to start paddling.

And depending on the conditions, how hard to paddle. (think position sizing - but more on that later. Right now we just need to practice standing up.)

You’re paddling, you’re feeling the wave starting. You stand up on your board, set your sights on managing your ride, and simply follow your plan to the exit.

All your focus is now on the price action during your trade.

Just as a surfer is watching the wave he’s riding - looking at its curve and shape, its speed, size and watching out for dangers along the way - so is the trader.

You have a plan in place in case you see different variables pop up. But otherwise you’re simply riding the trade, taking the rep and riding as long as you can, or until you get to your target.

Just like surfing, price action in trading is best learned through experience.  
The more you do it, the more nuances you pick up and the more confident you become.

# Bonus principle: Film your surf session, take notes!

In both surfing and trading, reviewing your performance is essential for improvement. Just as a surfer might film their sessions to analyze technique, you can track and review your trades to identify patterns, strengths, and areas for growth.

Journaling your setups, entry and exit points, and emotional state during trades can provide invaluable insights over time. The goal is to iterate—refining your strategy with each trade (wave) to consistently improve your edge and execution.

I hope these principles can help guide as you build out your own unique conditions to become a more consistent and profitable trader.",2025-01-14 19:55:30,108,23,Daytrading

# The Fed’s Rate Cutting Future Sends Markets into a Tailspin

Last week’s hot jobs report delivered a curveball: 256,000 jobs added in December and unemployment down to 4.1%. The labor market's resilience prompted Wall Street to recalibrate its expectations, sending the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.8%, its highest since 2023, and dragging the 30-year yield close to 5%.

**Why Yields Matter**

When Treasury yields rise, bond prices fall—but the story doesn’t end there. Higher yields make bonds a more attractive option for investors seeking steady returns, causing a shift out of riskier assets like stocks. That’s why Monday saw tech-heavy indexes tumble as money flowed into fixed income. The surge in yields also raised fears that borrowing costs for everything—mortgages, credit lines, corporate loans—could climb, potentially slowing down economic growth.

**Wall Street’s Rate Cut U-Turn**

Before the jobs report, most analysts expected at least one or two rate cuts in 2025 to keep the economy cruising. Now, Bank of America has scrapped its forecast for cuts altogether, calling the report ""gangbusters"" and arguing that inflation risks remain high. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan still predict two quarter-point cuts but have pushed them back to mid-year.

**Inflation in the Driver’s Seat**

This week’s consumer and producer price reports could solidify—or shatter—the narrative. With oil prices rising and inflation still above the Fed's 2% target, there’s a growing possibility that the Fed won’t just hold rates steady but could even consider another hike if inflation doesn't cool.

The market's shift shows how quickly sentiment can turn. December was all about rate cuts; now, it's about whether any easing will happen at all. Investors are left wondering if they’re witnessing a soft landing—or if the economy’s strength could backfire and keep stocks in a chokehold.

# Market Movements

* 📺 **Media giants cancel Venu Sports streaming service:** Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney, and Fox scrapped their joint sports streaming service Venu Sports before launch, citing market saturation and a $220 million legal settlement with Fubo. The decision underscores a shift toward optimizing existing platforms amid heightened competition.
* 📢 **Meta's policy overhaul raises concerns:** Meta's transition from third-party fact-checkers to a community notes system has sparked fears among advertisers about misinformation and brand safety. The company’s pivot, alongside the discontinuation of key DEI initiatives, has intensified debate about its strategic direction and commitment to content moderation.
* 📉 **Apple iPhone Sales Decline:** Apple's global iPhone sales fell by 5% in the fourth quarter of 2024, with market share slipping from 19% to 18%. This decline is attributed to underwhelming upgrades and intensified competition from Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi and Huawei, particularly in China, where sales dropped by 24% year-over-year.
* 🛠 **Microsoft forms new AI division:** Microsoft created the CoreAI - Platform and Tools group to unify its AI and developer teams under former Meta exec Jay Parikh. CEO Satya Nadella emphasized the focus on an ""AI-first"" application infrastructure to strengthen Azure’s AI ecosystem.
* 🔄 **Honeywell Considers Breakup:** Honeywell International Inc. is poised to proceed with a breakup following pressure from activist Elliott Investment Management to split. This strategic move comes amid discussions to enhance shareholder value and operational focus.
* ⚖️ **Apple faces $1.8B UK lawsuit:** Apple is defending against a $1.8 billion class action lawsuit in the UK, alleging its 30% App Store commission inflates app prices for consumers. The case marks a major legal challenge under new UK tech regulations and could reshape global app marketplace practices.
* 🧠 **Johnson & Johnson acquires Intra-Cellular Therapies:** Johnson & Johnson's $14.6 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies aims to bolster its neuroscience portfolio.

# White House Tightens Grip on AI Chip Exports

The Biden administration is making a final move before handing over the reins—introducing sweeping export restrictions on advanced AI chips. These rules aim to curb China’s access to cutting-edge technology by capping how much computing power can be sold to most nations. The twist? Close allies like Japan, the UK, and South Korea get a free pass.

**Who’s Feeling the Heat**

Companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Oracle are sounding the alarm, warning that the new rules could backfire by driving buyers toward Chinese competitors. Nvidia’s government affairs VP called the restrictions ""sweeping overreach,"" arguing they could jeopardize America’s hard-won lead in AI. Stocks responded accordingly—Nvidia dipped nearly 2%, while AMD and Intel saw similar declines.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo defended the move, emphasizing the delicate balance between national security and economic interests. While gaming chips and basic semiconductors are exempt, data centers in nations like China, Russia, and Iran face strict licensing requirements.

**What Happens Next?**

The incoming Trump administration will have the final say after a 120-day comment period. While the two administrations share concerns over China’s military ambitions, Trump’s team will determine whether to enforce or tweak the rules.

AI chips aren’t just about faster computers—they’re the backbone of national security. The restrictions could hinder China’s progress in developing military-grade AI while securing US dominance in the space. However, critics fear the controls might stifle innovation and open the door for workarounds in the global chip market.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The week’s economic marathon is just warming up, with tomorrow offering a lighter start—two smaller reports to set the tone.

First is the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index, a check-in on how small businesses across the U.S. are holding up. They’re the backbone of the economy, so their outlook on things like sales and hiring can offer valuable hints about where things are headed.

Then comes the Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks what domestic producers pay for supplies. November’s PPI came in above forecasts, though core PPI held steady. This time, analysts are hoping for signs of cooling, especially as the manufacturing sector faces ongoing headwinds. ",2025-01-13 23:01:55,2,0,Daytrading

Day Traders of Reddit: Help Me Pick the Right Broker Before I Lose My Sanity!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1hxrm4x/day_traders_of_reddit_help_me_pick_the_right/,"Hey, fellow traders! 👋

I've been paper trading for a solid year and a half, and I'm finally ready to take the plunge into real trading with a broker. But before I do, I need some *serious guidance* from you seasoned pros and trading veterans.

# My Background

* **Style:** Intraday scalp trading. I focus on high-volume big-cap stocks like Nvidia, Tesla, AMD, and Meta.
* **Market Hours:** Strictly intraday trading—no premarket or extended hours.
* **Orders:** Primarily limit orders (no chasing tops or bottoms, but still aiming for good fills).
* **Margin:** Yes, I plan to margin trade. (I’m aware of PDT rules—no need to go down that rabbit hole.)

# The Dilemma

I’ve tried out a few platforms, but all I get from reviews is *mixed signals* that make me feel like a deer staring into headlights. Here’s my rundown so far:

1. **Thinkorswim (TOS) / Charles Schwab**
   * Not my cup of tea—too clunky and overwhelming for my taste.
2. **Webull**
   * I *love* the clean interface and simplicity, but I’ve heard horror stories about order fills being delayed or incomplete. Some say it’s fine; others call it a dumpster fire for execution speed. What’s the truth here?
3. **IBKR (Interactive Brokers)**
   * TWS desktop is decent, but I’ve also read it’s hit-or-miss for execution quality. Plus, connecting IBKR to TradingView seems like a mess.
4. **TradingView Integration**
   * I really like TradingView for charting, so whichever broker I choose, I’d like to integrate it seamlessly with TradingView. But I’ve heard both IBKR and Webull have issues here (disconnects, lag, etc.).

# What I’m Looking For

* A broker with a **clean and intuitive platform**.
* Reliable and fast **order execution** for scalp trading on high-volume stocks.
* A platform that works smoothly with **TradingView** for charting.

# What’s Driving Me Crazy

Every time I read Reddit threads, half the comments praise a broker, and the other half bury it six feet under. To make it worse, people rarely mention their trading style, which might explain their experiences. (Like, are they premarket warriors? Swing traders? CFD folks?)

So here I am, creating my own post in **2025**, hoping for up-to-date advice from people who actually use these brokers *and know their stuff*.

# Calling All Day Traders!

If you’re a pro, an experienced trader, or just someone with solid insights, I need your help:

* Is Webull really as bad for order fills as people say?
* Is IBKR worth dealing with despite the TWS quirks?
* Are there other brokers I should consider for my style of trading?

Here’s the updated section with your focus on scalping, limit orders, and addressing specific concerns:

# Calling All Day Traders!

If you’re a pro, an experienced trader, or just someone with solid insights, I need your help with these specific questions:

* For scalping big-cap stocks like Nvidia, Tesla, AMD, and Meta during intraday trading, is Webull a reliable option? I’ve heard mixed reviews about order fills and execution speed.
* Is IBKR’s desktop platform (TWS) good for intraday scalping, or are the horror stories about poor execution still true? Have they improved things recently, or is it still a gamble?
* Are the old Reddit horror stories about Webull and IBKR just outdated fluff, or are these issues still relevant for someone like me who mainly trades common stocks, not options?
* Given that I’m using limit orders most of the time (and a few market orders here and there), will I still run into execution problems with either platform?
* Since I’m not trading options (which I know can require a more robust broker), does that make these platforms better suited for my intraday scalping needs?

I’d love to hear from anyone with recent experience using these brokers for similar trading styles. Are these platforms functional for what I need, or should I look elsewhere?

Thanks in advance for your wisdom, and happy trading! 🚀",2025-01-10 00:20:44,25,71,Daytrading

Cernece $CRNC ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1hu7vcg/cernece_crnc/,"Hey there, tech enthusiasts and investors! Today, I want to talk about Cerence (NASDAQ: CRNC), a company that's shaping up to be a major player in the automotive AI space in 2025.
Cerence has caught my attention for several reasons. They're a leader in AI technology for vehicles, with solutions present in over 500 million cars globally. What's really exciting is their expanded partnership with NVIDIA to enhance their CaLLM™ language models. They're focusing on generative AI and large language models for advanced voice interactions in cars, which could be a game-changer.
Looking at their financial outlook for 2025, Cerence is estimating revenues between $236-247 million, with adjusted EBITDA forecasted at $15-26 million. They're also anticipating free cash flow of $20-30 million. These numbers suggest a company on the path to growth and profitability.
Some key innovations to watch out for are their CaLLM and CaLLM Edge - language models optimized for the automotive industry. They're integrating with the NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform for improved performance, which could give them a significant edge. Cerence is also focusing on reducing latency and improving privacy and security in vehicle interactions.
Of course, it's important to consider the risks. The automotive AI sector is highly competitive, and while profitability is expected to return in 2025, it's still not a certainty.
What do you think? Do you believe Cerence will become a household name in automotive AI in the coming years? I'd love to hear your thoughts",2025-01-05 14:12:19,5,1,Daytrading

# Biden Blocks $14 billion Acquisition Of US Steel By Japan’s Nippon Steel

In a move straight out of a geopolitical drama, President Biden hit the brakes on Nippon Steel’s $14.1 billion bid for US Steel, claiming the deal posed a ""credible threat"" to national security. The decision followed a recommendation (or lack thereof) from the CFIUS, which punted the call to the White House after failing to reach a consensus.

**A Steel Defense**  
  
Biden framed the decision as a win for American resilience, calling US Steel essential to critical supply chains, infrastructure, and national defense. His statement didn’t hold back, stressing that US Steel needs to stay “American-owned, American-operated, by American union steelworkers.” The United Steelworkers union cheered the announcement, while Nippon Steel and US Steel cried foul, calling the move political theater.

**Boardroom vs. Courtroom**  
  
The drama isn’t over. Nippon Steel and US Steel plan to take their fight to court, accusing Biden of prioritizing union optics over economic sense. The failed bid leaves US Steel’s future uncertain—it may have to restart the sale process or go solo after years of financial challenges. Meanwhile, Cleveland-Cliffs, an earlier bidder, could circle back, but even that’s murky now.

**Tariffs and Trade Tensions**  
  
This decision doesn’t just shake Wall Street; it could strain ties between the US and Japan. Nippon Steel’s leadership, already frustrated with Biden’s stance, hinted that the ruling sends a “chilling message” to international investors. With Trump’s return looming and his history of tariff love on deck, the US steel sector may be facing a new era of protectionism—again.

For US Steel, surviving alone might be tough. For investors, it’s an open question: What’s next in the battle for America’s industrial crown?

# Microsoft’s $80 Billion AI Bet, Building the Future of Cloud Computing

Microsoft is making waves with a massive $80 billion investment in AI-focused data centers this fiscal year. More than half of the funds will be spent in the U.S., aiming to bolster the company’s infrastructure for handling skyrocketing AI demand. Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, made the announcement in a blog post emphasizing the importance of private-sector innovation and warning against ""heavy-handed regulations"" under the incoming Trump administration.

**The AI Arms Race**  
  
Big tech players, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, are in a race to dominate AI computing capacity. Microsoft’s spending spree is largely tied to its partnership with OpenAI and its drive to incorporate AI across its products. In just the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Microsoft shelled out $20 billion in capital expenditures, primarily on data centers packed with Nvidia GPUs—the gold standard for AI workloads. The goal? To stay ahead of global competitors, particularly China, which has been wooing developing nations with subsidized AI infrastructure.

**Powering AI with Nuclear Deals**  
  
High-powered data centers require immense energy, and Microsoft’s solution involves nuclear power deals—including an agreement to reopen the infamous Three Mile Island reactor. The company isn’t alone—Amazon and Google have signed similar deals as they expand their cloud capabilities.

**A Policy Pitch**  
  
Smith’s message wasn’t just about numbers; it was also a call to action. He urged the Trump administration to adopt policies that support AI growth through education, targeted export controls, and global promotion of U.S. AI technologies. The concern is clear: China’s growing influence in the AI space could shape the future of global tech ecosystems, with Smith advocating for the U.S. to lead not by complaint, but by action.

As AI reshapes industries, Microsoft’s investment signals that the future of cloud computing will hinge on who can build the fastest, most powerful infrastructure. The $80 billion question is whether this arms race will yield the AI dominance Microsoft is betting on.

# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Next week was shaping up to be the first full grind of 2025—until President Biden declared January 9 a national day of mourning for President Jimmy Carter, who passed away at 100 on December 29. That means the stock market will take a breather, while the bond market shuts down at 2 p.m. ET.

But don’t expect a lull in data drops. Monday kicks off with factory orders, Tuesday brings the ISM services index and JOLTS, and by Wednesday, we’ll see ADP employment numbers and consumer credit. The grand finale? Friday’s all-important US jobs report.

Earnings season is also dusting off the cobwebs. The real wave hits mid-January, but a few early players are reporting next week:

* **Wednesday:** Albertsons ($ACI), Jefferies Financial Group ($JEF)
* **Thursday:** Walgreens Boots Alliance ($WBA), Constellation Brands ($STZ), KB Home ($KBH)

"THE POWER OF CONVICTION!  ""Big move is expected tomorrow for NVDA and NQ to follow....""  PART 2",https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1hspbev/the_power_of_conviction_big_move_is_expected/,"4 days ago I posted my opinion.  I've made a mistake of assuming that last day of the year rally will take place, oh well, rally took place a few days later.

In the world of predictions, especially when it comes to financial markets, having conviction often means standing alone. When I stated confidently that NVIDIA’s stock (NVDA) would rise above $142, the response was less than encouraging. The majority not only doubted me but chose to express their disbelief in ways that were far from constructive.

It is human nature to resist what we cannot immediately understand. A new perspective can seem threatening, particularly when it challenges the consensus. But I’ve always believed that the market rewards those who do their own analysis and trust the indicators that have proven their value over time.

Today, with NVDA trading above $143.50, my prediction has been validated. This isn’t just a win for me but a reminder of the importance of discipline, patience, and belief in one’s work. The journey wasn’t about proving others wrong—it was about staying true to what I saw and believed, regardless of the noise.

To those who doubted: skepticism is healthy, but arrogance in dismissing new ideas rarely serves anyone well. Perhaps next time, a touch of humility and openness to alternate viewpoints might lead to better outcomes. After all, the market doesn’t reward insults; it rewards insight.

To everyone navigating this complex world of stocks: may your analyses be sharp, your convictions steadfast, and your attitudes open to learning from all—even those you initially disagree with.  For the record, as of this writing NVDA is trading way above $143...

# S&P 500 Crushes 2024

The S&P 500 wrapped up a 24% gain this year, riding high on an AI-fueled rally and resilient economic performance. That marks its best two-year run since the late ‘90s. But with interest rates staying sticky and stock valuations looking lofty, 2025 might not offer the same fireworks.

The Magnificent Seven—tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft—did much of the heavy lifting, contributing over half of the index’s gains. Meanwhile, financials and industrials showed some love, proving this year wasn’t all about tech.

# Winners and Losers

This year brought some clear standouts (and faceplants) across the board:

* **The Big Winners:**
   * **Palantir (+356%)**: The AI darling scored big on government contracts and made its Nasdaq 100 debut.
   * **Vistra (+262%)**: Nuclear power fueled the company’s impressive run as it capitalized on AI data center demand.
   * **Nvidia (+178%)**: Kingvidia kept proving why it’s the go-to for AI chips, smashing earnings and surpassing $3 trillion in market cap.
* **Under the Radar:**
   * **GeneDX (+2,811%)**: The biotech firm saw a jaw-dropping surge, despite still chasing profitability.
   * **Applovin (+735%)**: This mobile gaming and ad-tech company skyrocketed, crossing $100 billion in market value.

But not everyone had a banner year—stocks like Intel and Disney struggled as they tried to shake off operational challenges.

# Looking Ahead

2025 might feel a little different. Here’s why:

* **Valuation Pressure:** The S&P 500 trades at 21.9x forward earnings—well above its 10-year average. That’s a lot of faith in companies to deliver stellar results.
* **Earnings Growth Expectations:** Wall Street is betting on 15% growth, up from 9.5% in 2024. Big shoes to fill, especially for companies stretched by inflation and cautious consumer spending.

Still, analysts see room for small caps to shine. The Russell 2000, down nearly 9% from its 2021 high, might benefit from lower borrowing costs as the Fed continues cutting rates.

# What’s the Call?

Wall Street forecasts the S&P 500 will close 2025 near 6,678. Some expect a steady climb (Oppenheimer: 7,100), while others see a more cautious trajectory (UBS: 6,400).

But let’s be real: No one predicted two years of 20%-plus gains. So, while 2025 might demand more patience, the bulls aren’t ready to pack it up just yet.

# 2025: A Year of AI, Utilities, And Crypto

As we step into 2025, three themes are already making waves in the markets: the ongoing AI revolution, utilities adapting to the future of energy, and the ever-volatile crypto world. Let’s break down why these sectors are set to dominate the headlines and portfolios this year.

# AI

The AI boom isn’t just a flash in the pan—it’s becoming a foundational force across industries. Generative AI tools are finally hitting mainstream adoption, with massive investments in infrastructure and ever-more powerful chips paving the way.

* **Nvidia** remains the undisputed leader, but new players are emerging as the AI ecosystem diversifies.
* Expect AI’s influence to extend beyond big tech into sectors like healthcare, finance, and even entertainment.

BlackRock predicts that the ""AI flywheel"" is just starting to spin, and 2025 could be the year it powers real-world applications, turning the hype into tangible economic impact.

# Utilities

As AI grows, so does the demand for energy. Big tech’s sprawling data centers are guzzling electricity at unprecedented rates, forcing a transformation in the utilities sector.

* Microsoft’s nuclear revival at Three Mile Island was just the beginning. Expect to see more investments in alternative and renewable energy sources to keep up with AI’s needs.
* Grid infrastructure is also getting a tech upgrade, with companies racing to modernize and meet surging demand.

Utilities, often overlooked, are now becoming an exciting growth story, with UBS and Goldman Sachs both recommending overweighting the sector for 2025.

# Financials and Crypto

Donald Trump’s return to the White House has sparked a new era of deregulation, giving banks and financial services firms a major boost. Reduced compliance costs and pro-business policies are expected to free up capital and fuel growth across the industry.

But the real twist? The lines between traditional finance and crypto are blurring. Institutional adoption of crypto is accelerating, with major banks now offering bitcoin custody and blockchain-based financial services to high-net-worth clients.

* **Bitcoin’s resurgence**—vaulting past $100,000 in 2024—has put crypto firmly back on the map.
* Blockchain applications, from smart contracts to supply chain tracking, are starting to show their real-world potential.

Together, financials and crypto represent a powerful combination of stability and innovation, making them a standout play for 2025.

# Zooming Out

AI, utilities, and financials aren’t just sectors—they’re the engines driving 2025’s economy. Whether it’s through technological innovation, energy transformation, or policy shifts, these themes are reshaping the market landscape.

For investors, the challenge isn’t finding opportunities—it’s deciding which ones to seize. After all, 2025 is shaping up to be anything but predictable. ",2025-01-01 00:37:51,1,0,Daytrading

The S&P 500 fell 1.1%, the Nasdaq dropped 1.2%, and the Dow slid 1%. A light news day left investors with little to rally around, and a lack of trading volume didn’t help matters either. Hopes for a last-minute Santa Claus rally? Fading fast.
* While stocks stumbled, Treasuries found some footing, with the 10-year yield easing to 4.54%. On the housing front, pending home sales rose for the fourth straight month, marking their highest level since early 2023. But with just a handful of trading hours left in the year, it seems the markets are wrapping up 2024 on a sour note.

# Nvidia Locks In $700M AI Play

Nvidia has closed its $700 million acquisition of Israeli AI startup Run:ai, a move designed to optimize AI infrastructure and extend its dominance in the booming artificial intelligence sector. Regulatory hurdles? Cleared for takeoff—at least in Europe.

**Opening the Playbook**

Run:ai’s software, which helps maximize the efficiency of Nvidia’s GPUs, will now be open-sourced. Translation: competitors like AMD and Intel can use the software too. Why share the crown jewels? Nvidia’s move could be a play to quiet antitrust critics while expanding its influence across the broader AI ecosystem.

The startup, which Nvidia has worked with since 2020, adds a critical layer to Nvidia’s growing empire—helping power everything from data centers to cutting-edge AI systems.

**Antitrust Drama**

The deal wasn’t a breeze. Regulators in the EU gave the green light after a deep dive but didn’t miss the fact that Nvidia already controls about 80% of the GPU market. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice continues to take a closer look, adding a hint of uncertainty to Nvidia’s unchecked expansion.

For Nvidia, the stakes are high. As AI reshapes industries, its latest acquisition shows it’s not just chasing innovation—it’s determined to own the infrastructure behind it.

# Jeju Air Tragedy Sends Shockwaves Through Aviation

Boeing shares dropped 2% Monday after a tragic Jeju Air crash in South Korea killed 179 people, making it the deadliest aviation disaster in the nation’s history. Investigators are now looking into potential causes, including a bird strike and landing gear failure, as South Korea orders emergency inspections of all 737-800 planes in the country.

**The Timeline**

Here’s how the tragic event unfolded: Flight 2216, carrying 181 passengers and crew from Bangkok to Muan International Airport, declared a mayday after receiving a bird strike warning. The pilot aborted the first landing attempt, but during the second attempt, the landing gear failed to deploy. The jet skidded off the runway, struck a wall, and exploded into flames. Only two crew members survived.

Officials retrieved black boxes for analysis, while the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing are lending support to the investigation. The 737-800 has been a reliable aviation staple, but this incident has raised serious questions.

**Why It Matters**

This isn’t just an isolated event—it’s a major moment for Boeing, which is still reeling from past controversies surrounding its 737 Max series. South Korea has 101 active 737-800s across carriers like Jeju Air, Korean Air, and T’way Air, and the crash has spurred a nationwide inspection to ensure compliance with safety protocols.

Adding to the scrutiny: Jeju Air’s stock hit an all-time low following the crash, and Boeing is under pressure to uphold the reputation of its long-standing workhorse model. Aviation analysts believe investigators will closely examine bird strike standards, emergency response protocols, and why the landing gear wasn’t deployed.

**Bigger Picture:** The tragedy also lands during political upheaval in South Korea, where Acting President Choi Sang-mok has declared a week of mourning. For Boeing and South Korean aviation, this is more than a PR crisis—it’s a test of safety practices in one of the industry’s most trusted aircraft models.",2024-12-30 23:22:15,1,0,Daytrading
Changed the way I trade and results improved dramatically,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hptbd4,"I started trading in 2020 when the whole GME and AMC was a thing. I thought wow it is that easy to make money! I would often place risky trading ya know DIAMOND HANDS, YOLO, TO THE MOON. All I ever wanted was to get rich quick and...well things took a wrong turn. I took breaks there and here whenever I got super frustrated when I lost profits from trading options. I would gain and lose but I kept trying and was hoping to make the money back. 

Then something changed this year in Sept. I told myself I needed a new strategy and that whatever I did then was not working out for me so I decided to ditch options and just trade with shares and this is mostly from QBTS and NVIDIA as I believe in these two stocks. I kept myself discipline and worked out my errors. Swinging shares just was a better approach for me and seeing the results the past 3 months makes me feel very proud of myself. 

Do not give up, keep yourself grounded...work on your errors and eventually you'll see what strategy works well for you :)

The Dawn of an AI Explosion: Six Exciting Breakthroughs for the Next Decade!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1hpj1ec/the_dawn_of_an_ai_explosion_six_exciting/,"https://preview.redd.it/0fvliahj8y9e1.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=849ec971d2a5783046e9e75d0348af27e3ad1822

Will Bryk, CEO of the Silicon Valley AI company EXA, recently experienced the o3 large model and remarked, “Humanity stands on the brink of an explosion in AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)!



He predicts that the next ten years will witness six major breakthroughs, each more thrilling than the last, especially the final one, which is full of imagination. Here are his detailed predictions:



1. AI Solving Fundamental Physics Problems

   AI may help humanity tackle some of the most challenging puzzles in physics, such as quantum entanglement and dark matter. Just as AlphaFold successfully unraveled protein structures, AI's capabilities will elevate scientific research to new heights.



2. A Boom in Robotics Technology

   Future robots won't just be tools—they'll be intelligent partners capable of assisting in building bases on Mars and the Moon. Tesla's Optimus and domestic companies like Yusu Robotics are rapidly evolving with the support of large models, signaling an impending explosion in robotics technology.



3. Zero-Side-Effect Bioenhancers

   AI is likely to develop bioenhancers with zero side effects, enhancing human functions without leading to dependence or adverse effects. This will represent a revolutionary advancement in human health.



4. Drone Commuting Becomes a Reality

   In the future, we might commute via drones, akin to what NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang described: “These flying machines will become flying intelligent robots.” The intelligence and proliferation of drones will radically transform how we travel.



5. Resolution of the Energy Crisis

   Breakthroughs in technologies like nuclear fusion, geothermal energy, and solar power will completely solve global energy issues. Companies like Google and Microsoft have already surpassed the total electricity consumption of some countries (e.g., Azerbaijan and Jordan). Once nuclear fusion technology matures, humanity will no longer have energy concerns.



6. A Fantastical Future Driven by AI

   The most anticipated breakthrough is that AI may lead to advancements in:

   \- Discovering signals from extraterrestrial life

   \- Inventing room-temperature superconductors

   \- Solving the Riemann Hypothesis in mathematics



Bryk predicts that these innovations will make the coming years “mad enough to be unimaginable.” 

Given the excitement surrounding these predictions, even one of them could trigger a whirlwind in the investment market, explaining why stocks associated with AI concepts often surge. The potential for the future is vast, especially for low-priced small-cap stocks that are more susceptible to capital inflows. For those who enjoy investing in small-cap stocks, keep an eye on these popular AI stocks: $VERI, $REKR, $AIFU, $SOUN, $RGTI.",2024-12-30 08:47:47,0,0,Daytrading

# Nordstrom Checks Out of Wall Street

Nordstrom is saying goodbye to public markets. The founding family, with a little help from Mexican retailer El Puerto de Liverpool, has agreed to take the department store private in a $6.25 billion deal.

**Back to Basics**

The Nordstrom family isn’t new to this game. Their first attempt to take the company private in 2018 flopped, but this time, they’ve got backup. Liverpool will grab a 49.9% stake, while the family holds the majority. Shareholders will get $24.25 per share in cash—a nice premium for a stock that’s struggled to keep up with the times.

Why now? The public markets haven’t been kind. Nordstrom’s revenue never fully recovered after the pandemic, and the company has faced increasing competition from online players and discount chains.

**Private Mode: Engaged**

Taking Nordstrom private could give the company the room it needs to make changes without shareholders breathing down its neck. Department stores are no stranger to activist investors pushing for cuts, closures, and spin-offs—an escape from that pressure might be just what Nordstrom needs.

Nordstrom Rack, its off-price chain, has been one bright spot lately, recovering from past missteps. But with department stores overall in decline, even Rack’s resurgence isn’t enough to make public investors swoon.

**New Partnership, New Hope**

Liverpool, a retail heavyweight in Mexico, sees the deal as an opportunity to expand its footprint beyond Latin America. Known for running some of Mexico’s biggest department stores and franchises like Pottery Barn, Liverpool could bring a fresh perspective to Nordstrom’s playbook.

For now, the Nordstrom family is betting big on their legacy—and hoping private life gives the chain a much-needed second wind. Whether they’ll thrive or just escape the spotlight remains to be seen.

# New Year, New Fed Votes

The Federal Reserve is shaking things up in 2025, with fresh faces joining the committee that sets the country’s interest rates. And with inflation still sticking around like an unwelcome party guest, their decisions are bound to get tricky.

**Who’s In?**

This year’s rotation brings four new voters onto the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC): Boston’s Susan Collins, St. Louis’s Alberto Musalem, Kansas City’s Jeff Schmid, and Chicago’s Austan Goolsbee. These officials will weigh in on how fast to lower rates—a hot topic as inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target.

Outgoing members like Cleveland’s Beth Hammack have made headlines for dissenting in recent months, highlighting growing divides within the Fed. Expect more disagreements next year as policymakers tackle thorny questions about the economy.

**Slow and Steady**

Incoming members seem inclined to pump the brakes on rapid rate cuts. Musalem has already flagged concerns that inflation progress could stall, while Schmid has emphasized the need for cautious moves to avoid financial market chaos.

Collins and Goolsbee, meanwhile, lean toward gradual easing but stress that the final destination for rates remains uncertain. Goolsbee summed it up: “Inflation is way down, but rates still have a fair amount to drop over the next 12-18 months.”

**A Wild Card Year**

The backdrop for these decisions? Potentially inflation-boosting policies from the incoming Trump administration, including higher tariffs and tax cuts. Add in a labor market under pressure, and 2025 could be the Fed’s most challenging year yet.

Chair Jerome Powell, fresh off a quarter-point rate cut in December, has signaled that future moves will depend entirely on the data. Translation: Don’t expect much action at the January meeting, but buckle up for a year of debates, dissents, and careful recalibration. ",2024-12-24 01:10:44,2,0,Daytrading

Finally quitting day trading ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hi4v47,"I thought the next time I would post would be to show everyone I finally broke even and made my money back. This is not the first time I quit, I quit several times through the journey but always came back. I stopped when I hit my max loss of 15k, came back after that, new max loss of 25k, still came back after that. Now I just hit 35k total loss and I’m done for good. I can’t come back now and will never since I just withdrew the remaining funds and am laying back towards the debts I owe. 
I wanted to prove all the Wendy’s employees wrong. My entire journey was only based on making back my losses and getting out at breakeven.  Starting off down a couple grand months ago it’s all been downhill. I made some big daily gains but always followed it up with much bigger losses. There are so many lessons I learned throughout my time trading and I actually thought I got the hang of it at times and could consistently make money. However, I’ve realized trading is a scam and the stock market is all BS manipulated by algorithms. 

My parents were generous enough to give me a loan to trade and I blew their money. Day trading consumed me like a gambling addict and I couldn’t eat, sleep, be happy with my wife until I made my money back.  I remember going under 25k and having PDT violations. I called up my mom again begging for money, she sent me more and I topped off my account. Week after that I went under again and now I’m asking my wife for funds she gives it to me.  I’m feeling like a drug addict at this point. Every few days I’m withdrawing money from my bank account and sending into Webull to fuel this mess. As soon as pay day arrived from work I would immediately transfer the money into my brokerage account. I know I will piss a lot of people off but I knew there was a major problem when I took out a large 401k loan against my retirement account.  I couldn’t believe it but I lost that money too in just a few weeks.  I wish I never started trading.  I loved being a day trader since it gave me dreams. It gave me the hope and chance to maybe have freedom someday and not have to work a 9-5. Or that I could make huge money and buy my family a house or gifts for my wife.  My wife doesn’t even know the extent of my losses yet.  She’s just been supportive and trusts me to do the right thing. 
I’m quitting everything now since I actually stopped day trading and tried out buying and holding stocks.  I bought AMD on a dip and if you can see how much I’ve lost on that.  It just keeps dropping and dropping and I’ve given up on that too.  
I don’t recommend anyone day trade. I wish I never learned about this I would have no debts and be such a happier person.  The reason is because most of the gains that happen on stocks are all over night.  Throughout the day the stocks would sell off and overnight jump up.  I was literally fighting to make such small dollar amounts on trades when overnight jumps were huge. If you look it up you can see that most gains happen overnight and buying throughout the day and closing before the end is just not a smart idea. 
All of you say that it’s not gambling if you have an edge.  Well screw that, if you have an edge at black jack or can count cards at poker you’re still gambling. An edge in trading realistically only game me a 50% win rate.  After considering spread between bid and ask I always end up net negative.  Furthermore level 2 data is all manipulation and bs.  So many times I saw a huge buyer at a support level and would buy right above them.  As soon as I get in the price immediately drops through that level and nothing shows on the time and sales about that buyer. Clearly they are pulling their orders.  
Sorry for going on so long but overall this game is all crap.  It’s a losing battle and I don’t recommend anyone do it.  I’ve failed my family, failed my wife, and mostly myself. It’s taken me a lot of courage to pull the plug for good.  Worst part is. If I just bought and held NVDA when I started trading 8 months ago I would have been up nearly double my account.

# Honda and Nissan Might Merge to Take on the Big Dogs

Honda and Nissan—two of Japan’s auto heavyweights—are reportedly kicking the tires on a potential merger that could reshape the global car game. The alliance would create a combined force capable of challenging Toyota at home and Tesla, plus those nimble Chinese EV makers abroad.

**From Rivals to Ride-Sharers**

Talks are still in the “what if we…” phase, but reports suggest the companies could form a shared holding company. Nissan’s 24% stake in Mitsubishi means the smaller automaker might join the party too, turning this into Japan’s most significant automotive shakeup since your dad gave up his stick shift. Together, the trio could clock 8 million vehicles a year, still a few laps behind Toyota’s 11 million, but enough to put some pressure on the global leaders.

For Nissan, it’s a much-needed tow. The automaker’s operating income nosedived 90% this year amid struggles in the U.S. and China. Honda, meanwhile, has been hustling to keep its EV ambitions alive while wrestling with rising development costs. A merger could streamline production and tech investment—two essentials for staying relevant in the EV race.

**The Toyota Problem**

Toyota has been eating everyone’s lunch, pulling smaller players like Subaru, Suzuki, and Mazda under its wing to dominate the EV-hybrid market. A Honda-Nissan team-up could help level the playing field. Think shared EV batteries, consolidated R&D, and enough scale to punch back against Tesla and China’s BYD, which are sprinting ahead in electric cars.

Still, merging two fierce rivals is easier said than done. There’s overlap in their lineups, deep cultural differences, and, you know, decades of competition. As one analyst quipped, “They might share the road, but they’re not always driving in the same direction.”

**Markets Hit the Gas**

Investors love a comeback story, and Nissan’s stock surged 22% on the news, while Honda’s dipped 1.2%, as traders weighed the risk of pairing two struggling players.

If this sounds like déjà vu, that’s because Nissan’s been here before. Its long and messy relationship with France’s Renault ended in a complicated corporate divorce. Now, Nissan’s searching for a new partner to help it avoid stalling out.

**The Big Picture:** In an EV era where bigger equals better, this potential merger underscores a simple truth: carmakers need scale to survive. If Honda and Nissan can pull this off, they’d become the David to Toyota’s Goliath—a true heavyweight challenger in a market where the only real sin is being too small to matter.

# Dow’s Nine-Day Slide — Is It Really That Bad?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average just wrapped up its ninth straight losing day, marking its longest skid since 1978. While headlines scream “historic slump,” the story under the hood isn’t quite as dire—though it might feel like a blast from the Carter administration.

**What’s Dragging the Dow Down?**

Let’s talk about the index’s biggest weight: UnitedHealth Group. Shares of the healthcare giant have tumbled 21% since December 4th, when tragedy struck with the fatal shooting of its insurance CEO, Brian Thompson. Combine that with President-elect Trump’s recent vow to “knock out” healthcare middlemen like UnitedHealth, and you’ve got a recipe for investor panic.

But UnitedHealth isn’t alone. Cyclical stocks like Sherwin-Williams and Caterpillar—which surged post-election on hopes for deregulation and infrastructure spending—have since lost steam. Even Nvidia, a star player in 2024, is down 10% during the slump.

**Not All Markets Are Moping**

Here’s the kicker: the Dow’s funk isn’t dragging everyone down. The S&P 500 is holding strong near record highs, and the Nasdaq Composite hit an all-time high just yesterday, thanks to megacap tech’s ongoing dominance. Stocks like Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple are all thriving, but their wins barely register in the Dow’s quirky price-weighted formula, where share price matters more than market value.

In other words, the Dow’s losses aren’t a reflection of the broader market—it’s more of an index anomaly.

**So, Should You Worry?**

Here’s a little perspective: the Dow is only down 3.5% from its December 4th highs. That’s not even close to a correction, which kicks in at a 10% drop. More importantly, history is on investors’ side. December’s second half typically sees markets recover as traders ride seasonal trends into the new year.

Plus, Wall Street pros remain optimistic about 2025. If anything, this dip could be a “pause that refreshes,” as some strategists like to say—especially with the Federal Reserve decision on deck this week.

**The Takeaway:**The Dow’s nine-day losing streak may look grim, but let’s not confuse noise with signals. Tech stocks are booming, the broader market is in good shape, and this pullback might just be a breather before the bulls take over to close out 2024.

So breathe easy, Dow-watchers.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Sure, tomorrow we'll get some housing stats—like new builds and building permits—to gauge where the real estate supply is heading. But let's face it, the main event is the Fed.

The Federal Open Market Committee is wrapping up its last meeting of the year, and the market's betting big (over 95% odds) on another interest rate cut. But here's the kicker: this might be the final slice for a while, especially with 2025's uncertainties casting a shadow. Jerome Powell's words have been market movers all year, so tomorrow's decision feels like the grand finale in this monetary saga.

# After Market Close: 

* **Micron Technology** has been lagging behind its semiconductor peers, but investors are banking on brighter days ahead. Unlike Nvidia, Micron doesn’t make GPUs; it’s all about the memory market, where demand is expected to boom as AI continues to evolve.

* Investors are laser-focused on the Fed’s last meeting of the year, starting Tuesday. Hopes are high for one more rate cut to cap off 2024. While tech stocks keep stealing the spotlight, more traditional sectors are struggling to keep pace, leaving the Dow looking tired as the year winds down.

# Drones Are Soaring on Wall Street

Move over crypto and EVs, drones are the new darlings of both Wall Street and Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets. Shares of Red Cat Holdings (RCAT) skyrocketed 27% Monday after announcing a partnership with Palantir Technologies to integrate advanced visual navigation software into their drones. 

This AI-driven upgrade promises drones that don’t need GPS or radio control signals—a big win for military and government applications.

**Retail Traders Take Flight:** Red Cat isn’t just a hit with investors; it’s dominating Reddit’s meme-stock hub. The stock surged to the sixth-most popular ticker on r/WallStreetBets, gaining over 1,625% in mentions over the past 24 hours, according to Quiver Quantitative. With retail traders piling in, Red Cat’s 2024 performance is up a jaw-dropping 1,129%.

Other drone stocks also caught some tailwinds:

* **Unusual Machines** (+17.93%) got a lift from its Trump Jr. advisory board buzz. ($UMAC)
* **Kratos Defense and Security Solutions** (+5.40%) and **Aerovironment** (+7.86%) joined the rally.

**Drones Are Having a Moment:** It’s not just hype fueling the drone frenzy. Rising geopolitical tensions and an incoming Trump administration suggest increased spending on U.S.-made drones. Analysts are also bullish on federal and local governments ramping up counter-drone tech investments for public spaces like stadiums and airports.

Meanwhile, those mysterious drone sightings in New Jersey and across the Northeast have kept drones in the public eye—adding an element of intrigue (and meme potential).

**Reality Check:** While Red Cat’s stock soared during the day, after-hours trading brought turbulence. The company reported a revenue drop from $3.9 million to $1.5 million in the second quarter and widened its losses to 18 cents per share. CEO Jeff Thompson said the company paused production of its Teal 2 drones to focus on its next-gen Black Widow, prioritizing long-term growth.

**The takeaway?** Investors are betting big on drones, but as Red Cat’s mixed results show, not all growth stories take a straight path to the sky.

# Bitcoin Hits $107K: Bulls Keep the Party Going

The crypto king just smashed through $107,000, its latest *all-time high* after seven straight weeks of gains—the longest streak since 2021. Bitcoin is now up a casual 149% this year and 52% since the U.S. election. Not bad for a digital asset once pronounced dead roughly 426 times.

**Rate Cuts, Reserves, and Trump’s Crypto Cheerleading:** Today’s rally comes with a double-shot of market optimism. First, investors are nearly certain the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this week (96% chance, according to CME’s FedWatch Tool), which is music to Bitcoin’s ears. Lower rates = weaker dollar = Bitcoin-friendly environment.

Second, the crypto crowd is buzzing after Donald Trump reiterated his plan to establish a national bitcoin strategic reserve in a CNBC interview. It’s a move that feels ripped from the playbook of oil reserves but could cement Bitcoin as part of the financial infrastructure. Trump summed it up with, “We’re going to do something great with crypto.”

**MicroStrategy: All-In on Bitcoin:** If you’re looking for a Bitcoin proxy without forking over six figures for a whole coin, there’s MicroStrategy —the unofficial Bitcoin stock. Founder Michael Saylor, never one to undersell his bets, compared investing in Bitcoin today to “buying Manhattan 300 years ago.” The company doubled down on its BTC obsession, purchasing another 15,350 BTC last week, bringing its total haul to a staggering 439,000 coins worth $46 billion.

Oh, and starting Monday, MicroStrategy joins the **Nasdaq-100** index, meaning funds tracking the index will need to load up on its shares.

**The Takeaway: Hot Streak, Cautious Feet:** While the crypto market feels like a money printer right now, the pros still recommend treading carefully. Bitcoin’s price may be sky-high, but wild swings come with the territory. Whether you're HODLing or watching from the sidelines, one thing’s for sure: it’s never boring in Bitcoin-land.

# BuzzFeed’s Hot Sale: “Hot Ones” Gets a New Home

BuzzFeed just sold its crown jewel, *First We Feast*—home to the spicy celeb interview show *Hot Ones*—for $82.5 million. The buyer? A group led by Soros Fund Management, progressive media company Crooked Media, and YouTube duo Rhett and Link’s Mythical Entertainment. The deal marks a much-needed cash infusion for BuzzFeed as it battles mounting debt and declining valuation.

**Spicy Profits, Scorching Debt**  
  
While *Hot Ones* brings in about $30 million annually with its 14 million YouTube subscribers, BuzzFeed’s financial struggles have been anything but mild. Once valued at $1.5 billion, the media company is now worth around $150 million. This sale slashes BuzzFeed’s $120 million debt to $30 million, leaving it with more cash than liabilities—a small win in a tough media landscape.

Sean Evans, the host whose calm demeanor has guided celebs through fiery sauces, will stay on as Chief Creative Officer, while founder Chris Schonberger takes over as CEO. Both retain stakes in *First We Feast*, signaling the brand’s continued independence.

**BuzzFeed’s Comeback Recipe: AI?**  
  
With its debt cooling off, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti is turning up the heat on an AI-driven future. Peretti plans to lean into “tech-enabled services” and AI-powered content to reinvigorate the brand. But details remain vague, and questions linger: Will AI listicles bring the same viral charm that made BuzzFeed famous?

**Media’s Chicken Wing Moment**  
BuzzFeed isn’t alone in downsizing to survive. Legacy media giants like Vice, Vox, and even Disney-backed brands have faced layoffs or filed for bankruptcy as digital advertising wanes. Meanwhile, *Hot Ones* and other next-gen content creators are proving that niche, viral-friendly media with strong branding can still sizzle.

**The takeaway?** In a media world where old models are burning out, spicy creativity may be the secret sauce to staying relevant.

# YouTube TV Raises Prices Again

The streaming platform that once sold itself as a budget-friendly alternative to cable has inched closer to cable’s price tag. YouTube TV is hiking its monthly subscription to $83, effective January 13 for existing users, after already raising prices earlier this year.

**From Underdog to Overpriced?**  
  
Launched in 2017 at just $35 a month, YouTube TV entered the scene as a disruptor, offering live TV without the cable hassle. But over time, rising costs—mainly for live sports and programming—have pushed the price higher: $40 in 2018, $65 in 2020, and now $83. While the platform still delivers over 100 channels and unlimited DVR storage, the price tag leaves cord-cutters wondering if the “savings” pitch holds up.

**The Big Picture**  
  
YouTube TV isn’t alone in raising prices. Hulu + Live TV charges the same $83, but bundles Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu content. Sling TV starts at $40 but requires add-ons to match YouTube TV’s channel lineup. Meanwhile, cable providers are quietly looking like a relative bargain for those who don’t mind the old-school setup.

**Streaming’s Identity Crisis**  
  
When streaming began, it promised two things: affordability and simplicity. With subscription fees rivaling traditional cable bills and add-on costs for premium features like 4K streaming, the industry is testing consumers’ limits. For YouTube TV, the question becomes whether convenience—like easy cancellation and no contracts—is enough to justify its growing costs.

**The takeaway?** Cord-cutting isn’t dead, but it’s no longer the slam dunk it once was. Consumers now have to weigh whether the perks of streaming outweigh the price hikes—or if it’s time to reevaluate their subscription lineup. ",2024-12-14 01:51:47,1,0,Daytrading

# ServiceTitan Shares Soar 42% in Blockbuster IPO

The IPO drought may finally be lifting. 

ServiceTitan, a cloud software provider for home and commercial trades, made a blockbuster debut on the Nasdaq under the ticker $TTAN, with shares soaring 42% from their $71 IPO price to close at $101. 

The move gave the Glendale, California-based company a market cap of nearly $9 billion, offering a glimmer of hope for a tech IPO market that’s been in hibernation since 2021.

**From Plumbers to Public Markets**  
  
Founded in 2007 by two sons of tradesmen, ServiceTitan offers software tools to help electricians, plumbers, and landscapers manage scheduling, payments, and customer service. The company serves over 8,000 customers and generated $614 million in revenue for fiscal 2024, up 31% year-over-year, though it still operates at a net loss of $195 million.

The successful IPO reflects strong investor confidence in the company's growth potential, particularly as demand for its cloud solutions climbs. ServiceTitan’s cloud infrastructure business saw 52% year-over-year growth, cementing its position as a rising star in the tech sector.

**Navigating IPO Challenges**  
  
ServiceTitan’s road to the public markets wasn’t purely strategic—it was partially financial. A prior funding round included steep ""compounding ratchet"" terms, pushing the company to go public to avoid dilution penalties. 

he IPO raised $625 million, with a portion allocated to buy back preferred stock and pay off early investors. Despite the urgency, the IPO’s reception suggests strong market enthusiasm, with retail investors driving early gains.

**What’s Next for IPOs?**  
  
ServiceTitan’s debut isn’t just a win for its founders or venture backers like ICONIQ Growth and Bessemer Venture Partners—it’s a potential green light for other fintech and tech startups waiting in the wings. Analysts see the IPO as a sign that investor appetite for high-growth tech stocks is returning, even amid tighter monetary conditions.

For ServiceTitan, the next chapter includes leveraging its IPO proceeds to fuel growth, pursue acquisitions, and edge closer to profitability. As co-founder and CEO Ara Mahdessian noted, “Investors value durable growth and cash flow positivity—qualities we’re proud to deliver.”

With the Nasdaq Composite closing at record highs and tech giants thriving, ServiceTitan’s IPO success might just be the spark needed to reopen the IPO floodgates.

# Echelon Of Earnings

**⚡️Broadcom Powers Up on AI Hype:** Broadcom’s latest earnings call was an AI lovefest, with the chipmaker reporting a jaw-dropping 220% surge in AI chip revenue, hitting $12.2 billion for the fiscal year. CEO Hock Tan wasn’t shy about the company’s future, forecasting a $90 billion addressable market for AI components by 2027. While the broader semiconductor business is feeling a bit sluggish, AI is doing the heavy lifting.   
  
In Q4 alone, total sales reached nearly $14.1 billion, driven by the booming demand for AI processors and networking chips. Investors cheered, sending the stock up 14% in after-hours trading. Broadcom’s secret sauce? Two new hyperscaler clients and a growing AI infrastructure footprint that keeps it in the same conversation as Nvidia. ($AVGO)

**🤘🏼 Costco Keeps Rolling Despite Consumer Caution:** Turns out, bulk-size everything is recession-proof. Costco smashed Wall Street’s expectations with a $4.04 per share profit last quarter, thanks to its die-hard member base and a strong showing from both food and discretionary sales. Same-store sales jumped 7.1%, and online sales played a starring role in the retailer’s continued growth.   
  
Even as inflation forces some retailers to fight for scraps, Costco’s Kirkland brand and jumbo-sized deals are still luring customers through the doors. Seasonal items like furniture and jewelry are flying off the shelves, while food and groceries continue to edge out dining out. Investors liked what they saw—Costco’s stock is up 50% year-to-date, with no signs of slowing down. ($COST)

🥊 **Adobe Faces the AI Critics:** Adobe is finding out that even being a generative AI pioneer doesn’t guarantee smooth sailing. The company’s FY2025 guidance sent shares tumbling 13%, marking its worst day in two years. While Q4 results—$5.61 billion in revenue and $4.81 per share in profit—beat analyst estimates, the future is less certain. Investors are jittery over competition from AI startups like OpenAI, which are encroaching on Adobe’s turf with creative tools that could siphon market share.   
  
Adobe isn’t sitting still, though. Its AI tool, Firefly, has been integrated across key products like Photoshop and Premiere, logging a whopping 16 billion uses. Executives are betting on a new, higher-priced Firefly tier to boost margins in 2025. But Wall Street’s patience is running thin, with many still questioning whether Adobe can defend its position in an AI-driven world. ($ADBE)

# Amazon Adds 'Car Shopping' to Its Cart

Amazon is taking your online shopping spree to a whole new level—cars. 

The retail behemoth just launched *Amazon Autos*, letting you shop for a Hyundai like you would for an air fryer. Except instead of a Prime box at your door, you’ll pick it up at a dealership.

**The Details: Click, Scroll, Drive**  
  
Amazon Autos is debuting in 48 U.S. cities with Hyundai as its exclusive partner. Buyers can browse new models, customize trims and colors, estimate trade-in values, secure financing, and e-sign paperwork—all on Amazon’s platform. What you won’t get? Free two-day delivery. You’ll still have to visit the dealership to drive off in your new ride.

To sweeten the deal, Amazon is throwing in a $2,300 gift card for purchases made before January 10. Think of it as gas money, or, knowing Amazon, a chance to stock up on Alexa devices for your car.

**Why It Matters: Bye-Bye, Dealership Drama?**  
  
Car buying is infamous for its soul-draining haggling. Amazon promises to take that headache out of the equation by showing transparent, haggle-free pricing at checkout—taxes and fees included. Unlike Tesla’s direct-to-consumer model, Amazon keeps dealerships in the mix, playing the ultimate middleman. Hyundai dealers sell the cars; Amazon makes the process easier (or so they claim).  
  
Here’s the fine print: Amazon Autos is only offering new Hyundai vehicles—no used cars, no other brands (yet). Leasing and more expansive financing options are expected to roll out next year. Still, Amazon is clearly testing the waters, setting itself up as the one-click king of car buying.

**Bigger Picture: A New Gear for E-Commerce**  
  
This move isn’t just about Hyundai. It’s a clear sign Amazon is eyeing the future of car shopping, where the experience is more app-friendly than awkward-salesperson-at-a-dealership. Rivals like Carvana and CarMax should take note.

If Amazon pulls this off, imagine adding a car to your cart alongside your groceries.

# Apple’s AI Ambitions Take Shape with Broadcom Partnership

Apple is stepping up its game in artificial intelligence, teaming up with Broadcom to create its first AI-focused server chip, code-named *Baltra*. Slated for mass production by 2026, this custom silicon marks Apple’s latest move to reduce its reliance on Nvidia’s chips while carving out a space in the lucrative AI hardware race.

**Broadcom’s Boost**  
  
Broadcom shares climbed 5% on the news, reflecting the market’s enthusiasm for this partnership. Apple and Broadcom are reportedly prioritizing the chip's networking technology—a critical piece for handling the high demands of AI processing in the cloud. Apple is expected to use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s (TSMC) cutting-edge N3P process for *Baltra*.

This isn’t Apple’s first foray into chip design. The tech giant has successfully replaced Intel in its MacBooks with its in-house M-series processors, and now it’s channeling that expertise into server hardware to support AI applications.

**Catching Up in AI**  
  
While Apple has been slow to roll out generative AI compared to its Big Tech rivals, it’s starting to show signs of catching up. Recent *Apple Intelligence* features, including integrations for Siri and Maps, aim to leverage AI directly on devices. But for more compute-heavy tasks, Apple’s cloud infrastructure needs a serious upgrade—which is where *Baltra*comes in.

**Broadcom’s Winning Streak**  
  
Broadcom has become a top beneficiary of the generative AI boom, with shares up 54% this year following a massive rally in 2023. The company’s role in Apple’s AI chip ambitions further solidifies its standing in a market that could grow to $45 billion by 2028.

While Apple’s efforts won’t dethrone Nvidia anytime soon, the company’s pivot toward in-house AI hardware signals a strategic move to future-proof its ecosystem—and ensure Siri doesn’t get left in the dust.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The Producer Price Index (PPI) steps into the inflation spotlight next, offering a look at how prices are trending for the companies behind the goods and services we consume. While the CPI tracks costs for consumers, PPI is a wholesale measure of inflation that provides critical insights into the broader economic picture, even if it doesn’t get as much buzz.

In October, PPI remained flat month-over-month and rose 1.8% year-over-year. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, jumped 2.8%. Economists are watching closely for November’s reading, expecting a slight moderation to 2.5% annually. Meanwhile, the Fed’s other priority—employment—gets a check-in tomorrow with jobless claims data. Last week’s claims rose by 9,000 to 224,000, slightly above expectations but still below historical averages, and forecasts call for 221,000 new claims this week.

# After Market Close:

* **Broadcom** is doubling down on AI, and it’s paying off. While the chipmaker stumbled earlier this year with VMware tech, its last earnings report showed strong top- and bottom-line growth, putting those issues firmly in the rearview. Wall Street is bullish—12 of 14 analysts rate it a “buy,” with a price target 16% above current levels. Consensus: $1.39 EPS, $14.09 billion in revenue. ($AVGO)
* **Costco** isn’t just about bulk deals—it’s become a lifestyle choice, especially as inflation drives up grocery bills. The company has thrived in this environment, but with shares at all-time highs, valuation concerns are creeping in. Even with its rock-solid business model, investors are questioning how much higher it can go. Consensus: $3.86 EPS, $62.16 billion in revenue. ($COST) ",2024-12-11 23:34:31,1,0,Daytrading

# China Opens Probe Into Nvidia, Adding Heat to Global Tech War

Nvidia just found itself in Beijing’s crosshairs.

Chinese regulators launched an antitrust probe into the U.S. chip giant over its $7 billion Mellanox acquisition from 2020. The investigation centers on whether Nvidia violated conditions set at the time of the deal, like ensuring fair treatment of Chinese firms. Shares of the chipmaker dipped 2.55% on the news, a minor dent considering the company’s meteoric 188% rise this year.

**Escalation in a Global AI Arms Race**

This isn’t just about chips; it’s the latest salvo in the U.S.-China tech cold war. The Biden administration’s export bans on advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia, aim to curb China’s military and tech ambitions. 

Meanwhile, China’s response includes restricting exports of key raw materials and now flexing its regulatory muscle on Nvidia. Adding to the tension, President-elect Trump has promised steep tariffs on Chinese goods, potentially deepening the rift.

**Nvidia’s Global Scrutiny**

China isn’t the only one with questions about Nvidia’s dominance. U.S. and European regulators have also probed the chipmaker for antitrust violations in the past year, focusing on whether it’s leveraging its market power to unfairly edge out competition. 

While these cases often take years to resolve, they underline the risks of being the top player in the AI chip market—a sector critical for everything from large language models to military tech.

**The Bigger Picture**

Despite the regulatory clouds, Nvidia remains an investor favorite, riding high on AI’s explosive growth. But the ongoing scrutiny shows how geopolitical tensions and regulatory backlash can weigh even on the most successful players. For Nvidia, this could be a long game of managing compliance while staying ahead of rivals in the AI arms race.

The takeaway? Nvidia’s dominance might still be intact, but the scrutiny underscores how its position at the heart of the U.S.-China tech battle is both an asset and a liability.

# Mondelez Takes Another Bite at Hershey

Oreo and Ritz powerhouse Mondelez International has rekindled its interest in acquiring Hershey, the maker of Reese’s and Kisses, in a deal that could create a global snacks behemoth with $50 billion in combined sales. 

Hershey shares surged over 10% following the news, marking their best day since Mondelez’s first takeover attempt in 2016. Back then, Hershey rejected a $23 billion bid, and Mondelez walked away.

**Sweet Opportunity or Sticky Situation?**

Mondelez’s approach comes amid challenges for Hershey, including record-high cocoa prices and competition from health-conscious trends like GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. While Hershey’s iconic chocolate brands remain household names, the company recently lowered its sales outlook, citing inflation-weary consumers. 

The Hershey Trust, which holds 80% of the company’s voting stock, remains a key player in any potential deal. Its approval is essential, and history suggests they’re not easily swayed.

**The Stakes Are High**

This deal wouldn’t just be about chocolate. It’s a response to broader pressures in the packaged food sector, where companies are seeking mergers to combat slowing growth and rising costs. Mondelez, whose portfolio includes Toblerone and Cadbury, is no stranger to M&A and sees Hershey as a gateway to bolstering its North American dominance while expanding into new global markets.

But there’s a bitter side. Pennsylvania law could allow the state attorney general to step in if the Hershey Trust loses significant power, a hurdle that has derailed past attempts to acquire the chocolate maker. And let’s not forget the Federal Trade Commission, which might scrutinize such a large deal in today’s antitrust-focused climate.

**Takeaway:** A Mondelez-Hershey merger could redefine the global snack landscape, but it’s far from a done deal. With regulatory hurdles and Hershey’s storied independence at play, the outcome might hinge on whether Mondelez can sweeten its offer enough to satisfy both the Hershey Trust and cautious regulators.

"Trying to understand the market on a deeper level, a few questions:",https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1h8wlqv/trying_to_understand_the_market_on_a_deeper_level/,"Hello, I'm new to trading and I want to learn the stockmarket on a deeper level. I have a couple of questions I would love to have answered. Also, I would greatly appreciate references to articles or tips on any further reading.

1. Does stock expensiveness affect stock performance. For example, will a stock valued at 10$ behave differently than a stock valued at 100$ given that they're traded at similar rates. I understand that in general there may be more growth potential for the cheaper stock, but are there any other differences? 

2. How accurate are indicators? Things like RSI and ATX, I understand that these are applicable in some circumstances, but in general, how useful are they? Also, as far as I understand these measurements are quite old, do they still hold up, if not, are there any indicators that people use more frequently today?

  
3. My understanding of economy is pretty basic - basically supply demand. However, it feels like demand can be manipulated by certain factors suchs as group-think. For example, I hear Nvidia and Tesla are overvalued but they are still expensive on the market, presumably because of trader psychology. Following this logic - is trading of stocks based of ""vibes"" profitable as long as you know to sell before the burst?

4. For swing-trading, is it preferable to learn everything about companies in a specific sector, or is a more diverse understanding of macro-economics and geopolitics preferable?

# Lululemon’s Comeback Stretch, Biggest Surge Since 2008

Lululemon just turned heads—not with yoga pants, but with its Q3 earnings. 

The stock leapt 16% on Friday, its biggest single-day surge since 2018. While it’s still down 22% for the year (compared to the S&P 500’s 28% gain), the strong quarter has investors hoping the brand’s mojo is back.

**A Stitch Above Expectations**  
  
The numbers don’t lie: Lululemon clocked $2.4 billion in revenue, a 9% year-over-year jump, and earnings per share of $2.87—well above Wall Street’s $2.69 expectations. 

And for an encore, the company raised its full-year revenue outlook to as high as $10.49 billion. CEO Calvin McDonald credited the bounce-back to international growth and fresh product tweaks, like looser fits and seasonal colors.  
  
While U.S. sales dipped 2%, Lululemon found its footing abroad with international sales climbing 25%. China stole the spotlight, delivering a whopping 39% growth. 

The retailer’s strategic plan to hit $12.5 billion in annual revenue by 2026 seems less of a stretch now, thanks to its focus on men’s gear, global markets, and expanded e-commerce.

**The Takeaway:** Lululemon proved it can still flex in a crowded athleisure market, but challenges remain. U.S. consumers are feeling the pinch, and rivals are churning out leggings at lower prices. For now, the brand is balancing its domestic hurdles with international gains, showing it might just be the comeback kid Wall Street didn’t see coming.

# Chrysler: Once an Icon, Now Running on Empty

Once the pride of American automaking, Chrysler is now hanging on by a thread—and that thread is a minivan. 

The Pacifica, Chrysler’s sole remaining product, is watching its sales spiral downward, dropping 44% last quarter. Minivans might have been cool in 2000, but today, they’re about as relevant as Blockbuster.

**A Parent Problem**

Chrysler’s struggles are just one piece of the chaos at Stellantis, its parent company. Stellantis owns Jeep, Dodge, and Ram too, but it’s having a rough year. U.S. sales nosedived 20% last quarter, and its stock has tanked 40% year-to-date.

The company's average car price hovers near $55,000—making it a tough sell for price-sensitive buyers. Even after lowering prices, Stellantis has been bleeding market share and goodwill.

**Tariffs Could Break the Minivan**

Adding insult to injury, President-elect Trump’s proposed 25% tariff on Canadian imports could put the final nail in the Pacifica’s coffin. Built in Ontario, the minivan could become wildly expensive—or unprofitable to produce. 

Chrysler’s response? A reboot of the lower-cost Voyager minivan next year. It’s a bold move for a dying category, but it might just buy the brand some time.

Here’s the kicker: Chrysler’s dealerships also sell Jeep, Dodge, and Ram vehicles, making a shutdown relatively painless for Stellantis. Analysts expect the incoming Stellantis CEO to start with a full brand audit—and with only one fading minivan to its name, Chrysler’s place on the roster looks shaky.

**The Bottom Line:** Chrysler went from an industry titan to a brand with one lonely minivan struggling to stay afloat. With SUV-loving consumers, mounting tariffs, and Stellantis in turmoil, Chrysler’s survival will depend on a near-miraculous turnaround—or it could join Pontiac and Plymouth in the automotive graveyard.

Things are cooling down on the economic front, but there are still a few noteworthy reports to watch. Tuesday kicks off with the Small Business Optimism Index, while inflation takes center stage midweek with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropping Wednesday, followed by the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday. These inflation reports are the final clues the Fed will have before its two-day meeting starting December 17, where it’ll decide whether to deliver a parting rate cut for the year.

EARNINGS

SNPS review

* Synopsys ad a beat-beat with record earnings but Wall Street couldn’t figure out the guide, where there was an extra work week in Q124 that won't be there in Q125. SO the miss on guide is no big deal. It's unfairly down  I appreciated the design win conversations around design wins and PCIe6, CXL3, UCIe, ADAS, and 800gig demos. Read the full transcript it’s fascinating. The future is design by companies like Synopsys.   Good details on its alignment with ARM.  Ansys looks like a done deal with a few minor hurdles to go. This is such a huge opportunity given the need to meld micro with macro design. AI adds an accelerant to both.   Company looks to be taking a conservative and prudent approach to China given the uncertainty.

S - underwhelming quarter. should have seen a number of tailwinds with CRWD outage but they didnt really materialise for them this quarter. Not awful, but I expected more and likely most of the market did.

# Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger Out

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is stepping down, but not on his own terms. 

The board effectively pushed him out after frustrations over slow progress in regaining Intel’s footing in the semiconductor race. CFO David Zinsner and products leader Michelle Johnston Holthaus will serve as interim co-CEOs while the search for a permanent replacement begins.

Gelsinger’s tenure, which began in 2021, was marked by ambitious goals to revamp Intel’s manufacturing and compete with global leaders like Nvidia and TSMC. But his high-cost turnaround strategy failed to deliver results quickly enough for the board or investors. Shares have plummeted 61% during his tenure, and the company continues to face setbacks in both revenue and innovation.

**Stuck in the Chips Slow Lane**

Intel’s struggles go beyond Gelsinger. The company has long lagged behind in advanced chip production and missed opportunities in the AI boom—an area now dominated by Nvidia. Efforts to expand into foundry services, manufacturing chips for other companies, drained cash reserves without attracting major clients. Meanwhile, competitors gained market share in lucrative AI and data center sectors.

The board’s frustration reportedly came to a head over the lack of compelling products and the slow pace of Intel’s transformation into a contract chip manufacturer. While Gelsinger advocated for staying the course, the board decided it was time for a change, signaling potential strategic pivots ahead.

**A Tall Order for the Next CEO**

Whoever takes the reins will inherit a daunting task. Intel faces mounting challenges: catching up in AI chips, competing with better-funded rivals, and balancing a capital-intensive foundry business with waning investor confidence. The company also has $50 billion in debt, a stark contrast to its cash-rich days of dominating the semiconductor market.

Some analysts suggest Intel may need to spin off its foundry division to focus on core chip design, while others predict deeper cost cuts. Either way, the new CEO will need to act decisively to stabilize the business—and fast. As Intel grapples with its place in a rapidly changing industry, the stakes have never been higher.

# Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses bid to get $56 billion pay package reinstated

Elon Musk’s record $56 billion Tesla pay package has hit another roadblock. A Delaware judge upheld her earlier ruling voiding the 2018 compensation plan, despite a recent shareholder vote attempting to reinstate it. Judge Kathaleen McCormick criticized Tesla’s board for its lack of independence in approving the deal, citing undue influence from Musk.

The package, originally worth $2.6 billion and ballooning to $101.5 billion by today’s share prices, was the largest in U.S. corporate history. With the court’s decision, Tesla shareholders have effectively slashed Musk’s prospective payout—though his existing wealth, buoyed by Tesla’s stock rally, keeps him securely at the top of the billionaire leaderboard.

**Shareholders Step In, Court Stands Firm**

Tesla had hoped a June shareholder vote to ratify the pay plan would override McCormick’s concerns, but the judge wasn’t swayed. McCormick called the vote legally ineffective, refusing to accept what she termed “new facts” created to revise prior rulings. Tesla’s board now faces a dilemma: how to keep Musk incentivized without igniting further shareholder backlash or legal trouble.

In addition to voiding the pay plan, McCormick approved $345 million in attorney fees for the plaintiff’s legal team—a fraction of their initial $5.6 billion request but still among the highest awards in U.S. litigation history. Musk’s legal team has 30 days to decide whether to appeal.

**Bigger Battles Ahead**

This setback isn’t likely to slow Musk down. Tesla stock has surged 42% since Donald Trump’s election win, fueled by expectations that Musk’s ties to the incoming administration will yield business-friendly policies. However, with Tesla’s incorporation recently shifted to Texas and the legal dispute unresolved, uncertainty looms.

Musk’s influence over Tesla’s board and shareholder dynamics continues to draw scrutiny, and any new compensation plan will likely face similar challenges. Meanwhile, the billionaire’s ventures in AI, electric vehicles, and space exploration keep him at the forefront of industry and political intrigue—whether or not his paychecks match his ambitions.

# Amazon Throws Another $4 Billion into the AI Ring

Amazon is going all-in on artificial intelligence, tossing an additional $4 billion into Anthropic’s war chest. 

This San Francisco-based AI upstart, known for its Claude chatbot, has already secured $8 billion in Amazon investments—making it clear the tech giant wants a piece of the AI action. And the partnership isn’t just about cash. Anthropic is doubling down on AWS as its primary cloud provider, fully embracing Amazon’s Trainium and Inferentia chips to supercharge its AI ambitions.

This investment positions Amazon as a heavyweight in the generative AI arms race, where Anthropic competes head-to-head with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. 

As Claude gains traction in industries like finance and healthcare, Amazon is banking on Anthropic to help boost its AI credentials while offering businesses tailored AI solutions through AWS.

# Claude Gets a Cloud Boost

AWS isn’t just hosting Anthropic’s AI models; it’s adding exclusive perks to woo enterprise clients. For instance, AWS customers will soon get early access to a new Anthropic feature allowing them to fine-tune AI models using their own data. This unique offering sets AWS apart in a crowded cloud market and ensures Amazon gets a return on its massive investment.

Meanwhile, Anthropic has been busy leveling up Claude. Recent updates allow the AI assistant to perform human-like tasks on computers—think navigating websites and managing complex workflows. Add to that the launch of Claude Enterprise, and it’s clear Anthropic is aiming to dominate the AI-for-business space.

# AI’s Billion-Dollar Boom

Amazon’s big bet underscores the sheer scale of AI’s financial demands. Anthropic’s CEO predicts the cost of developing next-gen models could hit $100 billion in the near future—a steep climb from this year’s $100 million. But with the generative AI market expected to rake in $1 trillion within a decade, it’s a gamble Amazon is willing to take.

Still, not everyone’s cheering. Regulators are increasingly wary of tech giants gobbling up the AI market, with U.S. officials scrutinizing deals like this for potential anti-competitive behavior. 

But for Amazon, the playbook is clear: dominate AI, bolster AWS, and make sure it’s the cloud behind all the big brains of tomorrow.

# Gap Jumps After Lifting Outlook Ahead of Key Shopping Season

Gap Inc. is on a roll. Shares of the retail giant jumped 12% today after it raised its full-year outlook, marking a strong start to the all-important holiday shopping season. 

The company’s fiscal Q3 results outperformed Wall Street’s expectations, with earnings per share hitting $0.72 compared to the forecasted $0.58 and revenue climbing 2% to $3.83 billion. CEO Richard Dickson, who took the reins in 2023, credited the company’s turnaround to stronger brand identities, better pricing strategies, and nostalgic marketing campaigns.

Despite challenges like unseasonably warm weather and hurricanes that temporarily closed 180 stores, Gap’s holiday season is already looking promising. Dickson emphasized the company’s improved execution and momentum compared to a year ago, stating, “Our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year.”

# Breaking Down the Brand Performance

Gap’s eponymous brand saw a 3% increase in comparable sales, boosted by improved marketing and product offerings. Meanwhile, Old Navy, its largest revenue generator, posted flat comparable sales, slightly missing analysts’ expectations. 

Warmer weather impacted kids’ outerwear sales, but Dickson noted a rebound as conditions normalized. Banana Republic, the trendy workwear line, reported a 2% rise in sales but struggled with a 1% drop in comparable sales, reflecting ongoing efforts to refine its fundamentals.

Athleta, Gap’s athleisure brand, stood out with a 4% sales increase and a 5% boost in comparable sales, signaling a recovery under new leadership. The turnaround is particularly notable given last year’s 19% drop in comparable sales for the brand.

# Gearing Up for the Holidays

With four consecutive quarters of sales growth, Gap is banking on a strong holiday season to sustain its momentum. The company has raised its full-year guidance, now projecting sales growth of 1.5% to 2%—far above analysts’ expectations of 0.4%. Operating income forecasts were also bumped up, signaling confidence in profitability.

Looking ahead, Dickson’s strategy of leveraging nostalgia and celebrity partnerships seems to be paying off. While the company still faces challenges, particularly in product assortment and full-price selling, Gap’s recent performance shows it’s heading in the right direction. 

Investors and holiday shoppers alike will be watching closely to see if the comeback story continues.

# Next Week

Next week is a quick one, thanks to Thanksgiving shutting down markets on Thursday and trimming Friday’s trading to a half day. With only a few reports to track, the action is packed into just two trading days.

Tuesday brings real estate updates like the S&P Case-Shiller home price index and new home sales, alongside a snapshot of consumer confidence. On Wednesday, brace for a flood of data: initial jobless claims, durable goods orders, a GDP revision, and the main event—PCE inflation.

Earnings are similarly crammed into two days:

* **Monday**: Bath & Body Works ($BBWI), Zoom ($ZM), and Agilent Technologies ($A).
* **Tuesday**: Best Buy ($BBY), HP ($HPQ), Dell Technologies ($DELL), CrowdStrike ($CRWD), Analog Devices ($ADI), Abercrombie & Fitch ($ANF), Macy’s ($M), Burlington Stores ($BURL), Dick’s Sporting Goods ($DKS), Kohl’s ($KSS), and Manchester United ($MANU).

After that, it’s all turkey, touchdowns, and terriers in the Thanksgiving home stretch. ",2024-11-23 01:38:44,0,0,Daytrading

# MicroStrategy Tumbles After Citron Research Shorts the Stock

MicroStrategy’s stock nosedived 16% Thursday, courtesy of a scathing call from Andrew Left’s Citron Research. 

The once high-flying software-turned-Bitcoin hoarder got a cold shower as Citron accused it of floating far above Bitcoin fundamentals. The kicker? Citron is still bullish on Bitcoin but says MicroStrategy’s stock has become a clunky detour in a world of sleek Bitcoin ETFs.

Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin gamble turned MicroStrategy into the unofficial crypto ETF by amassing a jaw-dropping 331,200 bitcoins—worth over $31 billion. But with Bitcoin ETFs now making crypto exposure as simple as shopping on Amazon, investors might wonder if MicroStrategy’s stock is still worth the extra clicks.

# From Darling to Short Target: A Citron Twist

Here’s the irony: Citron used to be one of MicroStrategy’s loudest cheerleaders during its pivot to Bitcoin back in 2020. Fast forward to today, and Citron’s short position is a sharp reality check for Saylor’s strategy. 

Their main gripe? The stock’s value seems more like a speculative joyride than a sustainable business play.

Even with Bitcoin hitting a record $98,000, MicroStrategy’s reliance on hype over fundamentals has some investors tapping the brakes. Thursday’s tumble brought the company’s market cap back down to $89 billion—still hefty but a far cry from its momentary seat among the S&P 500’s big shots.

# Bitcoin Boom, But at What Cost?

Sure, MicroStrategy is still up over 500% this year—thanks, Bitcoin—but that kind of surge has its skeptics. Kerrisdale Capital made a similar call earlier, shorting MicroStrategy while betting long on Bitcoin. 

Their reasoning? You don’t need to ride the Saylor train when Bitcoin ETFs offer first-class seats.

Meanwhile, crypto miners like CleanSpark and Marathon Digital are picking up steam as alternative plays for Bitcoin exposure. And with President-elect Trump eyeing U.S.-only Bitcoin mining, the competition could heat up further.

# Comcast Spins Off Cable Networks

Comcast is putting most of its cable networks into their own sandbox, spinning them off into a new publicly traded entity called SpinCo. 

The move allows NBCUniversal to focus on its shinier toys—like streaming, theme parks, and entertainment—while cord-cutting continues to gnaw at the profitability of traditional TV. This strategic reshuffle sets the stage for a more streamlined Comcast, primed to compete in high-growth areas.

# Cable Castaways: What’s In and What’s Out

SpinCo will house networks like USA, MSNBC, CNBC, Oxygen, E!, Syfy, and Golf Channel, as well as digital properties like Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes. These assets brought in $7 billion over the past year but are increasingly seen as anchors in a sinking industry. 

Bravo and Peacock, however, are staying put. Why? They’re integral to NBCUniversal’s growth story, with Peacock recently flexing its muscles via Olympics coverage and an 82% revenue surge last quarter.

Leadership for SpinCo is already lined up, with NBCU veteran Mark Lazarus taking the CEO reins and Anand Kini serving as CFO and COO. The new venture is being touted as ""well-capitalized"" and ripe for partnerships—or maybe a few mergers, given the Trump administration's expected M&A-friendly stance.

# A Play for Growth, Not Nostalgia

The spin-off underscores the brutal math of the modern media landscape. Cable TV, while still profitable, lacks growth potential. Comcast’s move mirrors a broader industry shift, as rivals like Disney and Warner Bros. 

Discovery weigh similar strategies but haven’t yet pulled the trigger. Meanwhile, Comcast is all-in on its forward-facing ventures, such as Peacock, which now boasts 29% more paid subscribers and is nearing profitability.

NBCUniversal isn’t just banking on streaming. Its theme park arm is preparing to debut Epic Universe in Orlando, described as the most advanced park yet. Translation: It’s full steam ahead for investments in experiences people can’t stream from their couches.

# The Big Picture: Spin Now, Merge Later?

SpinCo won’t be left to fend for itself indefinitely. Comcast hinted at future acquisitions or partnerships to build scale in a fragmented cable market. With 70 million U.S. households still paying for cable, there’s value in consolidation—even if the long-term trajectory remains bleak.

For Comcast, this isn’t just about cutting loose legacy assets. It’s about unburdening its core business to take bigger swings in streaming and entertainment. As Peacock and Epic Universe gain momentum, the SpinCo experiment will test whether old-school cable can thrive—or merely survive—when left to its own devices.

# Tomorrow

Earnings season is wrapping up, with only a few notable reports left to trickle in next week. Tomorrow, though? It’s looking pretty quiet on the corporate front.

Instead, all eyes will be on two economic reports: Services and Manufacturing PMI. The PMI, a monthly pulse check on U.S. businesses, surveys companies about production, inventories, and overall conditions to gauge economic health.

The services sector has been on a roll, hitting 56% last month (anything above 50% signals growth) and marking its best showing since July 2022. Manufacturing? Not so much. With a 46.5% reading, it’s stuck in a seven-month losing streak. While rate cuts could eventually revive the sector, economists are still waiting for the tide to turn.",2024-11-21 23:50:32,1,0,Daytrading
trying to learn and find a long term strategy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1gwogym/trying_to_learn_and_find_a_long_term_strategy/,"Hi,

i have been watching the stock market since 2015 but I didn't really invest in the market because i wasn't experienced and was afraid of the risks, so I kinda missed a lot of opportunities, i could have bought anything and made over a million if i just held it for 10 years.

now I'm trying to start day trading and trying to make consistent monthly profit. i started last month by buying and selling nvidia and I made around 9% profit i was hoping to make 1% profit daily so 20% but it seems i need a lot more time in market and I'm limited by IBKR cash account and T+1.

I'm trying to buy only stocks that are part of S&P500 since i could hold it longer if it dipped and recover. but i want to find something more volatile and i want to be able to rebuy immediately without waiting for buying power, should i switch to crypto or forex to try to make 20% monthly? or should i just keep doing what I'm doing and try to make 6-10% consistently monthly?

i don't want to buy options/future or to use margin account because that's a lot of risk for what I'm trying to achieve.

what do you recommend for easy guaranteed profit (10-20% monthly) and low risk something that could be repeated (stocks/crypto/forex).

# Nvidia’s AI Crown Is Getting Heavier

Nvidia’s AI-fueled rocket ship is still flying high—but signs of turbulence are emerging. 

The chip kingpin posted a 94% revenue surge to $35.1 billion last quarter, with profits nearly doubling to $19.3 billion. It also projected $37.5 billion in revenue for the next quarter, fueled by Blackwell, its latest AI chip that’s as coveted as a golden ticket to Willy Wonka’s factory.

The results are a testament to Nvidia’s dominance in AI chips, which remain the go-to choice for companies scaling up their AI capabilities. But after several quarters of jaw-dropping growth, some investors are wondering if Nvidia’s star is starting to dim.

**Chipping In Everywhere**

Nvidia’s data center division—the heart of its AI boom—brought in $30.8 billion, a 112% jump. Blackwell chips are already powering big names like Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI, though demand is expected to outweigh supply well into 2026.

The gaming segment didn’t sit idle either, contributing $3.28 billion, driven by GPUs and Nintendo Switch console chips. Even the smaller automotive division revved up, with a 72% sales increase thanks to its self-driving car tech and robotics chips.

Nvidia’s AI dominance is also opening new doors, from drug discovery to sovereign AI investments—markets that could add billions in the coming years.

**Clouds Over Sunny Skies**

Despite the blockbuster numbers, Nvidia’s stock slipped 2% in after-hours trading. Why? Growth is slowing—albeit from sky-high levels—and competition is heating up. Rivals like AMD are sniffing around, while tech giants like Amazon and Google are building their own chips to cut reliance on Nvidia. 

Meanwhile, regulators in the U.S. and Europe are eyeing Nvidia’s more-than-80% share of the AI chip market, raising concerns about monopolistic practices. Add to that some engineering hiccups with Blackwell’s rollout, and the once-smooth journey has hit a few bumps.

**The AI Marathon**

For now, Nvidia’s dominance is unquestionable, but sustaining its meteoric rise won’t be easy. CEO Jensen Huang, who’s gone from chip visionary to tech icon, knows the AI race is a marathon, not a sprint. 

As Nvidia eyes opportunities in AI-powered robotics, national AI initiatives, and next-gen chips, the stakes have never been higher. 

While Huang works to outpace competitors and placate regulators, one thing is clear: the race to stay on top will be just as intense as the rise to get there.

# Target Shares Tumble on Earnings Miss

Target’s turnaround plans are feeling more like a Target cart with a wonky wheel. 

Shares nosedived 21% on Wednesday after the retailer reported disappointing quarterly results and slashed its profit outlook. Shoppers are skipping the nonessentials—like that one decorative throw pillow you didn’t need anyway—and Target’s attempts to avoid supply chain issues backfired, leaving it with bloated inventories. 

Meanwhile, Walmart’s stellar quarter only underscored Target’s struggles, making CEO Brian Cornell’s job of reviving the brand look even tougher.

**Walmart’s Got the Juice**

If Target’s struggling, Walmart’s thriving. The retail titan notched a 5.3% jump in U.S. comparable sales, boosted by growth in groceries and discretionary items like clothing. 

Costco is also flexing, with strong sales in jewelry and home goods. The key difference? Walmart is cleaning up by appealing to inflation-weary shoppers looking for low prices, while Target’s higher costs and focus on discretionary goods are scaring off budget-conscious buyers. In the battle for retail dominance, Walmart is leaving Target in the dust.

**Too Little, Too Late?**

Target’s efforts to recover—like price cuts on essentials and expanding private-label brands—aren’t landing as planned. Sure, there were some bright spots: foot traffic rose 2.4% and beauty sales sparkled, but overall, it wasn’t enough to counter sluggish demand for big-ticket items. 

Add to that a holiday season overshadowed by cautious consumers, and you’ve got analysts downgrading the stock faster than shoppers heading to Walmart’s aisles.

**What’s the Play Now?**

Cornell says Target is gearing up for the holidays, banking on stocked shelves and competitive pricing to woo customers. But with discretionary spending in the slump and whispers of tariffs under a new administration, the road to recovery looks bumpy at best.

If Target wants to win back shoppers, it’ll need more than discounts—it’ll need a hit that even Walmart can’t beat.

Buckle up—tomorrow’s data dump is packed.

First, we’ll get the weekly jobless claims. Last week, new unemployment claims dropped to 218,000, surprising just about everyone. Economists expect claims to creep back up to 220,000 tomorrow, but fingers crossed for another pleasant shock.

Then, there’s the S&P US Services PMI, which tells us how private sector services are doing. A score over 50 means business is booming, under 50 means the opposite. Last month, the PMI slipped slightly from 55.7 to 55.4, and economists are betting on more of the same this month.

Lastly, Factory Orders will give us a look at how manufacturers are holding up. Last time, orders jumped by 5%, but don’t get too excited—tomorrow’s forecast calls for a big ol’ zero in growth.

# Walmart Raises Outlook on Strong Spending From Value-Seekers

Walmart is sprinkling a little early holiday cheer on Wall Street. 

The retail giant reported stronger-than-expected sales, raised its annual outlook, and sent its stock to an all-time high. Adjusted earnings hit $0.58 per share, beating analyst forecasts of $0.53, while revenue soared 5% year over year to $169.59 billion, easily outpacing expectations.

**High-Income Shoppers, Bigger Baskets**  
  
Interestingly, it wasn’t just budget-conscious shoppers driving Walmart’s gains. High-income households, making over $100,000 annually, accounted for 75% of the quarter’s share growth. 

Shoppers were also spending more per trip, with the average ticket size increasing by 2.1%. And while discretionary items like toys and home goods finally showed some growth, groceries remain Walmart’s bread and butter.

**E-Commerce Is a Bright Spot:** Walmart’s online presence continues to shine, with e-commerce sales climbing 22%. Customers aren’t just shopping online—they’re paying extra for speedier deliveries, with 30% of orders now including a premium fee. 

Walmart’s digital strategy, bolstered by curbside pickups and its expanding third-party marketplace, is inching closer to profitability.

**Tariffs, Weather, and the Road Ahead:** Despite the holiday buzz, storm clouds loom. President-elect Trump’s proposed tariffs could push prices higher, potentially testing Walmart’s ""everyday low prices"" mantra. Warm weather has also dampened demand for seasonal items like clothing and heaters.

Still, Walmart’s diversified sourcing strategy and ability to attract high-income customers may help it weather these challenges, leaving competitors trailing as the retail giant marches into the holiday season with confidence.

# Qualcomm Expects to Make $22 Billion by 2029 From Expansion Bid

Qualcomm is dialing up its ambitions. 

The chipmaker announced that it expects $22 billion in additional annual revenue by 2029, fueled by expansions into PCs, automotive, and industrial applications. CEO Cristiano Amon’s strategy to diversify beyond smartphone chips, which still account for 75% of Qualcomm’s sales, seems to be gaining traction.

**PCs, Cars, and Everything Else**  
  
Qualcomm projects $4 billion in annual revenue from PC chips by 2029, a significant move into a market dominated by Intel. Automotive chips are expected to contribute $8 billion annually, a 175% increase from current levels, with 80% of that tied to existing contracts.

Other promising segments include industrial chips ($4 billion) and headsets ($2 billion). The company is also targeting opportunities in wireless headphones, tablets, and more.

**The Apple Problem and AI Opportunity**  
  
While Qualcomm is spreading its wings, it faces headwinds. Apple, a major customer, could cut ties as early as 2027, impacting modem sales. But Qualcomm’s focus on “edge AI”—bringing advanced AI capabilities to devices rather than relying on cloud computing—offers a potential lifeline. 

Executives suggested that chips running on smartphones today could soon handle tasks previously reserved for massive server farms.

**The Big Picture:** Qualcomm’s push to reduce reliance on smartphones is a response to shifting industry dynamics, like Apple’s in-house chip efforts and the growing demand for diversified tech solutions. With a total addressable market estimated at $900 billion by 2030, Qualcomm’s roadmap appears ambitious but calculated. 

However, with competition heating up in PCs and automotive, execution will be key to achieving these lofty goals.

No major economic data is dropping tomorrow, but keep an ear out for a few Federal Reserve governors speaking at various events—including Michelle Bowman, a name you might remember.

Bowman made headlines back in September as the lone dissenter when the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points, marking the first time in 20 years a Fed governor broke from the pack on a monetary policy decision. Talk about standing out.

Though she sided with the crew this month on a 25-basis-point cut, Bowman’s willingness to go against the grain makes her remarks tomorrow something to watch.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Target** may be a household favorite, but even fan favorites feel the squeeze. Earlier this year, the retailer slashed prices on thousands of products to entice budget-conscious shoppers—and they’re gearing up to do it again for the holiday season. Despite the markdown marathon, Target’s bottom line has stayed relatively steady, and analysts expect the previous quarter to hold up well. Still, shareholders are likely asking the big question: When does the discounting spree end? For now, the consensus calls for $2.30 EPS on $25.96 billion in revenue. ($TGT)

# After Market Close: 

* **Nvidia** continues to play the MVP role in the stock market. Its Magnificent 7 counterparts delivered solid earnings this quarter, and all eyes are on whether the chip titan—up nearly 190% this year—has more fuel in the tank.

# Tesla Stock Pops After Report Trump Wants To Relax U.S. Self-Driving Rules

Tesla stock zoomed over 5% on Monday after news broke that Trump’s transition team is hitting the gas pedal on federal self-driving car regulations. 

For Musk, this feels like a scripted Hollywood plot: championing Trump’s return to the White House and now potentially reaping the rewards. The potential framework would dismantle red tape, allowing Tesla to scale its futuristic Cybercab and Robovan models beyond the current 2,500-unit limit. Forget steering wheels and pedals—Musk’s robotaxi vision might finally leave the station.

**Regulatory Road Trip**  
  
Trump’s transition team has ambitious plans to reshape how autonomous vehicles hit the streets. Key names like former Uber exec Emil Michael and policy-minded Republican reps are being floated for leadership at the Department of Transportation.

Musk’s dream of making driverless Teslas mainstream—think fleets of robotaxis chauffeuring passengers without human backup—is closer than ever, thanks to these early-stage efforts. Cue the popcorn.

**Winners, Losers, and Sideliners**  
  
While Tesla basked in market love, Uber and Lyft investors weren’t thrilled, with both stocks dropping over 6%. 

Musk’s robotaxis could eventually outprice and outpace ridesharing apps. Meanwhile, Waymo and GM’s Cruise might feel the heat, as they’ve played it safe by sticking to autonomous cars with traditional controls. For Tesla, the stakes are clear: dominate the robotaxi race or stay stuck in regulatory limbo.

**Is This the Green Light?**  
  
Musk’s close ties to the incoming administration position Tesla as a frontrunner in the race for autonomous dominance. But before anyone pops champagne, Congress still needs to clear the road for mass deployment. 

If Trump’s team can pull this off, Musk’s long-promised vision could go from moonshot to market reality—steering the conversation and, potentially, the future of mobility.

# Super Micro Climbs Out of the Abyss

**A Compliance Comeback?**  
  
Super Micro Computer, a server maker basking in the AI boom spotlight, made a dramatic leap in after-hours trading, with shares spiking over 37%. 

The catalyst? A Hail Mary compliance plan filed with Nasdaq, complete with a new auditor—BDO USA—to replace Ernst & Young, who bailed last month citing governance concerns. Investors seem to believe Super Micro’s cleanup effort might actually stick this time.

**Scandals, Probes, and Short Sellers—Oh My!**  
  
The road here hasn’t exactly been smooth. Super Micro delayed its financial filings this summer, prompting a short-seller hit piece from Hindenburg Research and a DOJ probe.

Toss in a Nasdaq delisting warning, and this once $70 billion darling now finds itself valued at a mere $12.6 billion. Still, its pivot to AI-focused hardware has kept it relevant—and kept its ticker on traders' watchlists.

**AI Keeps the Lights On**  
  
Super Micro continues to ride Nvidia’s AI wave, unveiling products powered by the chipmaker’s shiny new Blackwell processors. That’s a big win in a market obsessed with AI innovation. 

But let’s not get carried away—Wall Street’s excitement is tempered by the company’s checkered financial reporting history and underwhelming guidance.

**Will It Stick?** With its Nasdaq fate hanging in the balance until February, Super Micro has a lot to prove. The company’s internal governance overhaul and fresh promises to meet filing deadlines could keep it afloat—if they deliver. For now, investors are cautiously optimistic, but like all good cliffhangers, we’ll have to wait to see how this one ends.

# Tomorrow

The housing market’s supply problem isn’t getting better anytime soon. Tomorrow’s report on housing starts will shed light on how many new homes are in the works, while building permit data will offer clues about what’s coming down the pipeline.

September didn’t bring much relief—new home construction dipped 0.5% to 1.35 million, and permits fell 2.9%. Economists expect October’s numbers to hold steady, but the real hope lies in lower interest rates eventually sparking a surge in builder activity. Fingers crossed.

Shares are trading at a premium compared to other retailers, edging into pricey territory. Translation: Walmart might be a stock worth holding, but not necessarily buying right now.

# Netflix’s Heavyweight Gamble: Tyson vs. Paul

**A Punch at Streaming’s Future**  
  
Netflix is stepping into uncharted territory ~~tonight~~ right now as it streams a high-profile boxing match between 58-year-old Mike Tyson and 27-year-old influencer Jake Paul. 

While the spectacle promises millions of viewers, it’s also a trial run for Netflix’s live-streaming chops ahead of broadcasting two NFL games on Christmas Day. For a platform that once dismissed live sports, this is a pivotal moment to prove it can handle the pressure—or risk being knocked out of the game.

**Betting Big on Live Events**  
  
This fight isn’t just about punches—it’s about ad dollars.

Of Netflix’s 283 million subscribers, 70 million are on the ad-supported tier, offering prime real estate for advertisers during live events. If the Tyson-Paul bout performs well, Netflix could command premium ad rates, mirroring the cable TV playbook.   
  
With live NFL broadcasts already sold out, Netflix is betting on its ability to leverage sports content for future growth.

**Streaming vs. Traditional Sports Networks**  
  
The event also marks a shift in boxing’s media landscape. Once dominated by HBO and Showtime, the sport is now migrating to streaming platforms like Netflix, DAZN, and Amazon Prime. 

Tyson and Paul’s fight is Netflix’s way of signaling its intent to compete in live sports broadcasting, even as it diversifies with long-term deals like the WWE’s *Raw*and the NFL’s holiday matchups.

**The Real Test:** While the buzz around the fight is undeniable, the real winner tonight could be Netflix—or not. If the platform falters under the strain of millions of viewers, it could undermine confidence in its ability to handle future live events. 

But if Netflix pulls off a seamless broadcast, it will solidify its place as a new heavyweight in the live sports arena, setting up a much larger bout: its battle against traditional sports networks.

# Meta To Face Us Antitrust Trial Over Acquisitions Of Instagram and Whatsapp

Meta’s decade-old acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp are finally getting their day in court. 

A federal judge ruled that the FTC’s antitrust lawsuit against Meta will go to trial, alleging that the company overpaid for these platforms to eliminate competition. If the FTC wins, Meta could be forced to part ways with its prized assets, reshaping the social media landscape. 

However, Meta scored a minor victory with one claim—relating to access for third-party developers—dismissed.

**Regulators Everywhere, All at Once**  
  
The hits don’t stop there for Meta. The European Union just slapped the company with an €798 million ($840 million) fine, claiming Facebook Marketplace unfairly leveraged its dominance in social networking to outmuscle rivals. 

Meta says it’ll appeal, but the penalty adds to a growing list of regulatory headaches that have investors questioning Big Tech’s resilience.

**What’s at Stake?**  
  
Meta’s empire is under siege. A breakup of Instagram and WhatsApp would mean a significant shift in its revenue streams and market power. Meanwhile, fines and lawsuits across the globe are hitting the balance sheet. 

For a company already navigating fierce competition from TikTok and others, the uncertainty around regulatory outcomes could stymie its future growth.

**A Global Reckoning for Big Tech**  
  
Meta isn’t alone in the hot seat. Antitrust cases against Amazon, Google, and Apple are ramping up, marking a bipartisan push to rein in tech monopolies. 

The stakes are high: these trials will set the tone for how governments worldwide handle Big Tech, creating ripple effects across the sector. Investors, brace yourselves—this is just the beginning.

For an industry already coping with waning COVID-19 vaccine demand, Kennedy’s HHS role injects new uncertainty. His anti-vaccine advocacy—and leadership of Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vax group—has industry players and investors bracing for possible policy headwinds. 

Vaccine manufacturers now face the risk of reduced immunization rates, which could pressure their bottom lines even further.

**Biotech Takes Note**  
  
Kennedy’s views extend beyond vaccines, casting a shadow over the wider biotech sector. With his skepticism about pharmaceutical companies, market watchers anticipate potential shifts in health policy that could impact drug development, approval timelines, and sales. 

Analysts are on alert, viewing Kennedy’s influence as a wildcard that could affect drugmakers’ performance across the board.

**Stock Market Reaction**  
  
The market is clearly concerned, and health stocks could be in for a bumpy ride if Kennedy’s nomination is confirmed. 

With his anti-establishment approach, the biotech and vaccine sectors might see a heightened level of volatility, as investors weigh the long-term effects of Kennedy’s potential policy pivots on the healthcare landscape.

Disney posted a strong Q4, crediting streaming wins and blockbuster hits for a 6% revenue rise, landing at $22.57 billion. 

Bob Iger, back in the driver’s seat, forecasted earnings growth in the high single digits for 2025, with double-digit jumps through 2027. That news sent Disney’s stock up 9%—a glimmer of magic in an otherwise challenging media landscape.

# Streaming Soars, Cable Sinks

Disney+ and friends (Hulu and ESPN+) notched a solid $321 million in profit, even adding 4.4 million new subscribers as its ad-supported tier gained traction. 

Meanwhile, cable kept sliding, with revenue down 38% in a quarter where cord-cutting hit hard. It’s clear: streaming is Disney’s leading role now, as cable fades into the background.

# The Box Office Magic Lives On

Thanks to *Inside Out 2* and *Deadpool & Wolverine*, Disney’s studio turned in $316 million in quarterly profits, with both films setting records.

# Spirit Airlines Braces for Bankruptcy

Spirit Airlines is flirting with bankruptcy after a last-ditch merger attempt with Frontier fizzled out. 

The ultra-budget airline is now in talks with creditors on a restructuring plan that would potentially wipe out its equity holders, sending Spirit’s stock plummeting over 59% on Wednesday. 

So, if you’re holding Spirit shares, let’s just say it might be time to buckle up.

# Grounded Merger Plans Leave Spirit Scrambling

Merger hopes were high for Spirit after talks with both JetBlue and Frontier put a lifeline in sight. But after JetBlue’s bid got axed by antitrust concerns, Frontier was the next best hope – until now. 

With that deal grounded, Spirit is left scrambling to negotiate its survival with bondholders. Analysts say that without a merger, Spirit may need to sell off aircraft and other assets to handle its hefty debt load, giving bondholders the upper hand over shareholders in any final deal.

# Trimming Wings to Stay Afloat

Already in belt-tightening mode, Spirit’s been trimming its fleet, furloughing pilots, and offloading older planes in a bid to free up cash. 

Yet, with a hefty $1.1 billion bond deadline on the horizon, the airline’s runway is looking short. Wall Street’s not holding its breath: with zero “buy” ratings and eight “sell” recommendations, the consensus seems clear. 

Now, it’s a waiting game to see if Spirit can emerge from this nosedive intact.

# Amazon Takes On Temu and Shein With Discount ‘Amazon Haul’ store

Amazon is making a play for the ultra-low-price crowd with its latest launch, *Amazon Haul*. Simply type “haul” into your amazon app and hit enter.

Touted as an affordable answer to Temu and Shein, Haul features a selection of everyday items capped at $20, with many under $10. In this new section, you’ll find deals like $1 iPhone cases and $5 packs of holiday socks. 

But there’s a trade-off: while Amazon has long been known for its quick Prime delivery, Haul shoppers will need to wait a bit—deliveries clock in at one to two weeks, mirroring the timelines of its Chinese rivals.

# Discounts Stack as Baskets Grow

To sweeten the deal, Amazon is offering extra discounts for larger orders, with 5% off for purchases over $50 and 10% off over $75, plus free shipping on orders above $25. 

The Haul selection covers a broad range of categories—from fashion and home goods to electronics and lifestyle items—all with an eye-catching “crazy low” price tag. Amazon’s VP of Worldwide Selling Partner Services, Dharmesh Mehta, says Haul is designed for those willing to wait a little longer to save a lot more, adding some fun and affordability to Amazon’s app experience.

It’s a clear signal that Amazon is targeting shoppers who prioritize deals over delivery speed.

# Playing the Long Game on Low Prices

Haul isn’t just a new section; it’s Amazon’s response to the rise of bargain-focused apps like Temu, which are chipping away at the traditional e-commerce model with rock-bottom pricing. 

Amazon’s willingness to take the slow lane on delivery suggests a bet on customers who are still more comfortable shopping with a familiar brand but are willing to explore lower-cost options. With all products screened for compliance, 

Amazon is aiming to sidestep the counterfeits and regulatory issues dogging Temu and Shein, providing Haul shoppers a budget-friendly and trustworthy shopping experience.

Expect last month’s hurricane chaos and labor strikes to show up here, so don’t be surprised if the numbers look rough. Jerome Powell likely won’t hit the brakes just yet.

We’ll also see the Producer Price Index (PPI), which shows inflation from the perspective of producers, not shoppers. Manufacturers have been taking it on the chin lately with rising costs and rates, but last month’s flat reading sparked a bit of hope that things might be stabilizing.

# Tesla Hits $1 Trillion Amid Trump Win

Tesla's back in the trillion-dollar club. Shares skyrocketed 8% Friday, pushing its market cap over the $1 trillion threshold as investors jumped on the potential for looser regulations in a Trump administration. 

Elon Musk, Trump’s most vocal supporter and a generous campaign contributor, saw Tesla surge about 30% this week alone. With hints at slashing electric vehicle subsidies and potential trade barriers for Chinese EV players, Wall Street sees a Trump-Musk partnership as a boon for Tesla’s market share in the U.S.

**A Boost for Musk’s Billions**

The Tesla rally has also catapulted Musk’s net worth past $300 billion, marking his highest fortune since 2021. Musk has been outspoken about leveraging his influence in Trump’s administration to accelerate federal approval for autonomous vehicles, a critical step for Tesla’s self-driving ambitions. 

The partnership comes at a strategic moment, with Tesla now vying against Alphabet-owned Waymo in the autonomous driving race.

**Trump Trade Implications for Tesla’s Competitors**

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives noted that Trump’s pro-business stance could place Musk in a highly favorable position, shielding Tesla from new EV subsidies that have leveled the field for foreign competitors. 

Meanwhile, U.S. rivals and industry giants like Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft now sit alongside Tesla in the trillion-dollar tech club, with Wall Street eagerly eyeing who will come out on top in this new era of deregulation.

# Retailers Are Prepping For Tariffs

Trump’s back in office, and with him comes a tariff policy that’s sending ripples through retail. With proposed tariffs up to 20% on all imports and a jaw-dropping 100% on goods from China, retailers are facing a fresh dilemma: absorb these costs or pass them onto consumers. 

According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), these tariffs could add up to $7,600 in annual costs for American households, leading to what the NRF warns could be a “tax on American families.” Retail stocks like Dollar General and Five Below have already started to feel the heat, dropping as much as 10% this week as they brace for rising expenses and tightening margins.

**Consumer Prices in the Crosshairs**

Retailers are in a bind: either eat the extra costs or send prices soaring. The NRF predicts these tariffs could zap as much as $78 billion in consumer spending each year if fully enacted. Price hikes in double digits are on the horizon for categories like apparel, electronics, and household items, hitting customers’ wallets hard. 

Stores that rely heavily on China for sourcing—like Five Below, Crocs, and Skechers—are particularly exposed, while discount chains worry that price jumps could scare away budget-conscious shoppers.

**Winners, Losers, and Tariff-Proofing Strategies**

Not every retailer is biting their nails. Giants like Amazon and Walmart, with massive buying power and diverse supply chains, are poised to weather the tariff storm. Meanwhile, brands like Steve Madden, already seasoned from Trump’s first tariff stint, have reduced reliance on China by nearly half to sidestep a hit. 

As some retailers scramble, those who’ve diversified early may have a head start in staying ahead of what’s shaping up to be another trade showdown.

# The Trump Trade Is So Back

With the confetti barely settled, Wall Street is jumping on the ""Trump Trade"" bandwagon, cheering on the promise of tax cuts, deregulation, and a whole lot of American-made everything. 

After Trump’s decisive win, investors seem ready to party like it’s 2017 all over again, driving stocks higher in celebration.

**Stocks Soaring, Banks Roaring**

In true Trump style, the biggest winners were unsurprising: Trump Media & Technology Group ticked up 6%, and Tesla shot up a whopping 15% as Elon Musk fans speculated his next role could come with a White House Cabinet badge. B

anks were also in for a big day with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo seeing double-digit gains—investors banking on lighter regulations are here for the ride.

Crypto fans are grinning ear-to-ear as Bitcoin hit a new high at $76,000, with Ethereum and Coinbase riding the wave of Trump’s pledge to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” And oil’s back in play, with fossil-fuel giants like Exxon enjoying a lighter-touch regulatory future.

**Clean Energy, Not So Much:** Not every sector is feeling the love. Green energy stocks like First Solar and Enphase Energy took a beating, down 10% and more, with the Invesco Solar ETF trailing alongside. Investors are worried Trump’s clean energy cuts could halt momentum for solar and wind.

**Bonds, the Dollar, and All That Jazz:** Treasury yields popped as bondholders braced for a more inflationary, debt-ridden policy path. And the dollar? It’s on a tear, seeing its biggest gain since 2020 as a higher tariff policy puts a chill on imports, boosting the greenback.

**The Bottom Line:** While Wall Street’s in a post-election high, the experts are wary. Veteran investor Leon Cooperman warned that traders might be “too optimistic,” and some analysts say it could be short-lived. For now, the “Trump Trade” seems full steam ahead, but as always in markets, it’s best to keep one hand on the exit.

# Prediction Markets Are Having Their Moment

Betting markets took a big W this week, as former President Donald Trump’s election win confirmed what sites like Kalshi and Polymarket have been shouting for weeks: the odds were in Trump’s favor, despite what the polls claimed. With bets pouring in as high as 70% for Trump on some platforms, it seems political markets may just be stealing the predictive spotlight.

Prediction markets are officially having a moment. Platforms like Kalshi, Polymarket, and even Robinhood are diving into event-based trading, allowing users to bet on anything from presidential outcomes to rainfall odds. 

For Wall Street pros and everyday bettors alike, these markets offer a new way to speculate—and maybe even profit—on real-world events. The appeal? While traditional investments hinge on long-term trends, event-based trading lets users cash in on predictions in real-time, giving them a front-row seat to high-stakes, headline-driven market moves.

**Trump Odds Surge, Betting Markets Get Serious**

The betting markets were on fire leading up to the election, with millions poured into wagers across various platforms. Kalshi, the only legal site for U.S. election betting, saw over $250 million in wagers, but Polymarket, the grey-market crypto platform, took it to the next level with over $3 billion in bets.

Robinhood even joined the game, rolling out election contracts a week before the final votes were counted. Clearly, everyone’s trying to cash in on this new political betting boom.

**The Winners, Losers, and Future of Election Betting**

On the winning side? Tesla, Bitcoin, and Trump Media all enjoyed post-election bumps. But this newfound love for political markets has the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) eyeing tougher regulations. They’re worried that this craze for betting on real-world events could be too risky for the average trader.

So, for now, betting markets are riding high, basking in the glow of their big election night win. Whether they’ll continue this streak without regulation raining on their parade? Only time (and a lot of bets) will tell.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s lineup starts with initial jobless claims—aka, the latest pulse check on how many folks are filing for unemployment. It’s a big deal for the Fed’s next rate move, though by the time these numbers hit, Jerome Powell and the crew will be locked in on their decision.

So, what’s the verdict? Analysts are betting hard on a 0.25% rate cut, and markets seem to agree, pricing in the odds of a trim at a cool 99.6%. It’s a smaller dip than the one in September, but that’s the Fed keeping things steady. The labor market’s been flexing some strength lately, so no need for the summer’s panic-fueled, jumbo-sized cuts.

But don’t get too hung up on the rate cut itself. Eyes should be on Powell’s press conference later in the day. The man’s words and the Fed’s follow-up chatter could tell us a whole lot more about their game plan for the months ahead.

# Before Market Open:

* **Planet Fitness** banks on members who sign up, then conveniently forget to show up. But the FTC’s new “Click-to-Cancel” rule could make those “set-it-and-forget-it” memberships harder to hold onto. The rule, aimed at simplifying cancellations, is still under legal review, so the company’s stock hasn’t taken a hit just yet. But if this rule sticks, Planet Fitness might need a new game plan to keep revenue pumping. Analysts forecast $0.58 EPS and $285.87 million in revenue. ($PLNT)

# After Market Close:

* **Pinterest** has been on a wild ride lately—a strong spring, followed by a tough summer slump thanks to lackluster guidance that sent shares tumbling. But now, with the stock looking relatively cheap, investors are tuning in to see if AI can be the growth engine Pinterest needs. All eyes are on management’s plans for AI-powered user engagement and revenue growth. Wall Street expects $0.34 EPS and revenue of $896.31 million. ($PINS)",2024-11-07 00:18:22,1,1,Daytrading

# Berkshire Hathaway’s Cash Fortress Tops $300 Billion

Warren Buffett’s cash stash at Berkshire Hathaway is looking more like a cash fortress, ballooning to a record-breaking $325 billion. 

It’s a fortune even Buffett isn’t sure how to spend, as he keeps dodging big-ticket buys and instead cashes out on old faves like Apple and Bank of America. Why the hoarding? Some say he’s just too seasoned to overpay in today’s market; others think he’s plotting something big.

Either way, he’s showing us what real self-control looks like.

**Apple on a Diet, Cash on a Bulk-Up**

Buffett trimmed Berkshire’s Apple stake by another 25% this quarter, whittling it down to $69.9 billion. Even though the iPhone maker still holds the crown as Berkshire’s biggest holding, it’s clear Buffett’s leaning out the tech exposure. 

The kicker? This isn’t a tech-love breakup, just a careful rebalancing to make sure Apple doesn’t end up becoming the whole show.

**Buybacks? Not This Time**

Usually, Buffett’s all about scooping up his own shares when Berkshire’s cash pile is high, but this quarter, buybacks took a timeout. And that’s surprising, given Berkshire’s been on a 25% winning streak this year. 

Analysts speculate he’s holding out for the *really* right moment to jump back in—because why not, when cash is stacking up faster than Wall Street can blink?

**Cash-Burning Dreams:** So, what’s next for Buffett’s billions? Will he finally splurge on something big, like a mega-acquisition? Or is he playing the long game, waiting for stock prices to cool off before making any serious moves? One thing’s clear: the Oracle of Omaha knows patience is a virtue—and he’s got the cash mountain to prove it.

# Palantir Reports Record Profit, Cites ‘Unwavering’ AI Demand

Palantir just dropped a knockout earnings report, sending its stock up 15% after hours. Revenue shot up 30% in Q3 to $725.5 million, leaving analysts' forecasts in the dust. But the real kicker? 

Demand for Palantir’s AI tech in the U.S. is off the charts, setting the company up for a stellar year with a new revenue target of nearly $2.81 billion.

**The U.S. Appetite for AI**

Business is booming stateside, with commercial revenue up 54% and government revenue climbing 40% year-over-year. CEO Alex Karp didn’t hold back, describing this as “unwavering demand” that’s positioning Palantir front and center in an AI-powered revolution.

The U.S. government’s appetite for advanced data tools is a big driver, making Palantir’s AI solutions essential for organizations seeking smarter, more efficient operations.

**Boosted Guidance Lights Up Investors**

With a solid quarter under its belt, Palantir has raised its guidance, now expecting full-year revenue to land between $2.805 and $2.809 billion—well above Wall Street’s estimates. 

Q4’s forecast looks equally strong, with revenue projected as high as $771 million. Given AI’s moment in the spotlight, investors are betting on Palantir’s long-term potential in this high-stakes arena.

**Global Hiccups, U.S. Dominance**

While the U.S. powers Palantir’s growth, international sales are a mixed bag, particularly in Europe, where commercial revenue slipped this quarter. Yet Karp remains optimistic, seeing the U.S. as the core of Palantir’s AI growth. 

As these tools become integral across industries, Palantir’s strong domestic foothold could keep it leading the pack, even as it navigates a few global bumps.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Two economic reports are due tomorrow—the ISM Services Index and a snapshot of the U.S. Trade Deficit. But, let’s face it, neither will come close to stealing the spotlight from the presidential election.

Election night means noise, lots of it. And with every update and needle movement, it’s tempting to hit the panic button. But seasoned investors know the real trick: tuning out the chaos and sticking to their strategy.

Here’s the game plan—keep calm, keep steady. The ones who make it big aren’t the ones glued to every election twist but those who play the long game, staying true to their plan no matter what.

# Before Market Open:

* **Ferrari** has been cruising on pure brand power. While most of the luxury market is slowing down, Ferrari’s ultra-wealthy customers barely feel the pinch, happily shelling out for a supercar that hits 0-60 in just 2.4 seconds. With a waiting list that stretches well into the future, Ferrari’s got smooth sailing for months, and management will likely be popping the champagne tomorrow to toast another year of market-beating gains. Consensus: $2.19 EPS, $1.79 billion in revenue. ($RACE)

DD: What is going on with China's recent developments in quantum computing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1idxpf3/dd_what_is_going_on_with_chinas_recent/,"Google [Tianyan-504](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google it, right now. Who’s reporting this? China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the markets don't seem to have a clue.

TL;DR: Simply put, I believe the markets have not reacted to China’s most recent advancements in quantum computing. China is potentially not as far behind the USA as markets would have you believe. I provide here a commentary of recent market movements, in relation to recent quantum computing news and developments. I follow with a more technical discussion of the significance of China’s advancements, those of US corporations.

Financial disclaimer: While I justify my comments where possible, some of the comments I make in this post are pure speculation. I do not recommend making speculative trades, such as shorting quantum computing, or buying quantum cybersecurity. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.

I was astounded to see the latest news dominating the headlines. How did the market not know that China was developing its own language-learning models? I’m a filthy casual, and even I knew about it. It’s been in our news at least [since July](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/20/deepseek-v2-0628-released-an-improved-open-source-version-of-deepseek-v2/), and available for use [since September last year](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news0905). It was pretty fucking good back then, too. And there’s Alibaba’s Qwenchat, Tencent’s HunYuan, among numerous others they haven’t even started talking about yet. What else have they forgotten, in this wild speculative bull run? They probably think the USA is lightyears ahead in quantum computing too. Oh, oh. They do.

Before you go any further, look up [Tianyan-504](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml). Look up [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11924). Google them, right now. They’re right there, massive Chinese developments both announced in December 2024. The Tianyan-504 surpasses 500 qubits, on par with IBM’s latest developments. And Zuchongzhi 3.0 demolishes Google’s earlier Sycamore by all key metrics. Why can’t we find any article produced by any reputable financial sources, that discuss the significance of these achievements? There is essentially zero market news about it. China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the market has no fucking clue.

Check out D-Wave stock prices, for example. Given their business model relies in part on how they contribute to research in the field, they should be negatively impacted by major research developments in competing economies.

https://preview.redd.it/4iggbqnq57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5089134b48021f96baf28b66e5a7dc377b7dee7

This suggests that while Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied quantum computing stocks and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down, China’s developments have had zero impact.

How about Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT)? It tells a similar story. Their focus is on fabrication of photonic quantum computing components – and again, providing researchers access to quantum computing technology. It looks like Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied stocks, and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down. China’s developments have had zero impact.

https://preview.redd.it/e9dnfa0s57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f77fb7a50a22340541b4c426433ff210c9a7fbe0

How about IBM? News about Google’s Willow pushed their price down some 3%, which makes good sense. Willow’s performace blew that of IBM’s September R2 Heron processor out of the water. Willow is a competitor, but IBM’s position in the market means they are diversified in so much more than just quantum computing. A small bearish reaction makes perfect sense. So when Tianyan-504 reportedly challenged IBM's benchmarks just three days before Willow did, why didn’t the stock price move?

https://preview.redd.it/y6t1ik5t57ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=5377770391681d2bfe3ac54d106217216c3f7feb

You can look at SkyWater Technologies (SKYT), and at Global Foundries (GFS), and Rigetti (RGTI), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), TSM (TSM), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Every one of these key companies relevant to advancing quantum computing in the Western World have one thing in common. When China announces their developments, the markets appear to stay still.

There are three possible reasons for this that I have come up with. There may be other reasons as well that I am not aware of, in which case I encourage you to enlighten me.

The first possible reason is as above: The market is generally not aware. It is likely that some players in the market are aware, and this is a simple piece of information that such players will be taking advantage of – they do not have incentive to highlight this knowledge. Furthermore, the market may be uniquely slow to react. Unlike DeepSeek, which we can physically interact with, breaking records in quantum computing research is less tangible, less sensational. Breaking news, markets are irrational.

The second possible reason is simple: China may be lying. I can not find any evidence to support this idea, and China’s past claims about quantum computing, such as those about [Jiuzhang](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), have been demonstrably true.

The third possible reason is that China’s quantum computers are not as technically advanced as they sound. Originally I wanted to follow with a full technical discussion about the recent history of Chinese Quantum computing, and the merits of Tianyan-504 and Zuchongzhi 3.0 in comparison to western quantum computing efforts. But since I am not a subject matter expert, and I do not have the time to write in full depth. But I will provide a bit more technical information, summarise and provide references to the academic research for relevant breakthrough technologies, so you can read for yourself.

China is fighting to lead the global race in quantum computing, and [the Chinese government has been investing tens of billions of dollars into quantum computing research](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/04/13/chinese-quantum-companies-and-national-strategy-2023/), alongside the investments of Chinese institutions and corporations.

In 2020 [Jiuzhang, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), was the second quantum computer in the world to achieve quantum supremacy](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), and the first photonic quantum computer to do so. Since then, the university has gone on to create further models of Jiuzhang, and develop chips with greater qubit lifetime and fidelity.

In April 2024, The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics developed their [Xiaohong superconducting chip](https://english.news.cn/20240425/a95b3c190a59486886f4cddc0def31cd/c.html), their most advanced to date, anticipated to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM’s Heron in key performance metrics including qubit lifetime (how long a qubit can hold its quantum state) and readout fidelity (accuracy in extracting information from qubits). I note the market did not appear to react to the Xiaohong chip either.

On the 13^(th) of November 2024,[ IBM announced their Quantum Heron R2](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), achieving their goal of running quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gates, demonstrating advancements in in qubit lifetime and readout fidelity.

On the 6^(th) of December 2024, [Tianyan-504 was announced](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml), developed by China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., and, built on the Xiaohong chips. China is now the only country to achieve quantum computational advantage through both photonics and superconducting quantum computing technologies. This quantum computer will be incorporated into their quantum computing cloud platform, and made available for researcher purposes.On the 9^(th) of December, [Google’s Willow was announced](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/). What makes Willow exceptional, is that it provides a breakthrough solution to quantum computing’s fidelity issue. It exponentially reduces the amount of error while adding more qubits. Presumably Willow can now be scaled further, and I expect to see further developments with adding more qubits now that this challenge has been solved.

Two weeks later, on the 16^(th) of December 2024, an entirely separate research team with the China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. [announced their Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.11924v1#S1). This superconducting quantum computer makes numerous advancements, and demonstrates quantum advantage through speed. It crushes benchmarks set by Google’s older Sycamore - “Compared to Google’s latest experiment, SYC-67 and SYC-70  the classical simulation cost of our 83-qubit, 32-cycle experiment is six orders of magnitude higher.” Though Zuchongzhi 3.0 does not demonstrate the error correction capability that Willow does, their creators have commented that they believe they can replicate the same techniques in a matter of months.

Quantum computing is still twenty years away from being relevant, they say. That gives lots of time for China to catch up. And from what I can understand, China is just one breakthrough away. There are other questions, such as China’s chip manufacturing capabilities, supply chains for components, that I am unable to find good information on. The US is doing what they can politically, through trade regulation, and restricting financial investment in China’s technologies. China already has the [lead in quantum communications, and potentially in quantum sensing](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/). But China holds one massive advantage: it’s regime. In contrast to the American model, where corporations closely guard their own secrets from eachother, [China is claims they invest 15 billion of dollars into coordinated, cohesive research.](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/) And it is showing in their results.

Each advancement that China makes in developing its quantum computing capability, ought to remind the market that there is a risk that the lead the US enjoys in quantum computing is being threatened. But look at those google search results again. Outside of technical circles, the western media simply hasn't picked it up. Look at what happened with DeepSeek. I think the markets just don't know. Investors are already anxious about their investments in quantum computing, and are starting to demand returns. Manufacturers are reluctant to scale component production, given the low demand and potential for volatility. So when the market does find out about China’s achievements in quantum computing, what's going to happen?

Let me know what you think.

Rare Market Divergence: A Warning Sign or Just a Blip?,https://i.redd.it/x29zfkfnw6ge1.jpeg,"Monday’s AI Shock Was Very Unusual

Nvidia led AI-related stocks in a sharp decline on Monday, pulling the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lower as well. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was higher on the day. Moreover, the equal-weighted S&P 500 (RSP) was flat on the day. While some of the largest-cap stocks fell significantly, most others were fine. Stocks from the recently underperforming sectors had quite a good day.

The graph, courtesy of SOFI, highlights the historical divergence. Despite the S&P 500 falling by about 1.5%, 199 more stocks closed higher than those that fell. Since 1996, we have only had three similar instances. All three occurred in the pre-dot-com bust surge. In hindsight, those three divergences were a warning of sorts.

Let's talk about META's earnings.,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1id1pqu/lets_talk_about_metas_earnings/,"Zuckerberg's earnings are today and I wanted to drop my 2 cents and see if anyone's up to discuss. I'm re-writing to better along with WSB's rules. I recently tried to make a post about Tesla but it was taken down too by an AI bot for being too political? This is my first discussion post so I'm really testing out the waters on this sub. 

Meta Platforms is set to announce its fourth-quarter results after the market closes and from what I've read analysts are predicting earnings of $6.76 per share, up from $5.33 a year ago. Revenue is expected to hit $47.04 billion, marking a 17% increase year-over-year. Right now it seems like people are particularly keen to see how Meta's hefty investments in artificial intelligence are paying off.

Unfortunately for Meta, DeepSeek has been making waves with its R1 model. It's a Chinese competitor that matches the capabilities of models from U.S. giants like OpenAI and Meta but was developed at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek's success has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, causing significant stock drops for companies like Nvidia. It's pretty common for China to steal proprietary tech and incorporate it into their own creations, but their AI is entirely open source, unlike OpenAI. This would allow American companies to, in turn, take their new research and work with it. For those who don't know, Meta themselves has an Open-Source Strategy. Their Cheif AI Scientist, Yann LeCun isn't sweating it, though. DeepSeek's R1 is open-source, just like Meta's own Llama model, which in turn validates Meta's open-source approach. Collaboration and transparency might be the goal in the AI race. However, people are wondering how such advancements could be made with such a low budget. This puts into question the amount of funding and money that's currently going into AI.

Despite the DeepSeek-induced drop, Meta's stock has shown resilience. Analysts at Citi argue that Meta could actually benefit from DeepSeek's innovations by incorporating them to enhance its own AI tools, potentially leading to more efficient operations and better returns on investment. As Meta prepares to unveil its earnings, everyone wants to see how the company plans to monetize its AI investments and respond to the rising competition from players like DeepSeek. The tech landscape is shifting, and Meta's next moves could set the tone for the industry's future.

But the earning call won't be entirely about AI. They obviously own Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Advertising remains the cornerstone of Meta's revenue, accounting for approximately 98% of its total income. I believe Meta's significant investments in artificial intelligence have enhanced its advertising capabilities. AI-powered tools like Advantage+ and generative AI enable advertisers to create highly targeted campaigns, leading to increased return on ad spend. The company reported a 7% year-over-year increase in ad impressions and an 11% rise in average ad prices. Over a million businesses utilized Meta's generative AI tools to produce 15 million ads in a single month, resulting in a 7% uplift in conversions.

Meta's platforms continue to see robust user engagement. The company boasts 3.29 billion daily active users, a 5% increase from the previous year. AI-enhanced content recommendations have driven higher engagement, particularly for video content, thereby boosting advertising opportunities. However, Despite these positive indicators, Meta faces several challenges. The company's Reality Labs division, focused on metaverse initiatives, is expected to report a $5 billion loss for Q4, continuing to weigh on overall profitability. Additionally, regulatory scrutiny, such as the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, poses risks to Meta's data-driven advertising model, potentially leading to increased compliance costs and fines. Competition from platforms like TikTok, Google, and Amazon remains intense, with TikTok's popularity among younger users particularly threatening Meta's growth in key demographics. Although Tiktok's impending ban might really help them monopolize the social media industry.

Everything is telling me that earnings will be bullish. Thoughts?",2025-01-29 19:06:21,25,15,wallstreetbets

 > Nvidia (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang will deliver the opening keynote at a major consumer electronics show on Monday, with many analysts viewing the event as a potential growth catalyst for the chipmaking giant. 

> **All but one of the 21 analysts covering the company who are tracked by Visible Alpha maintain a “buy” or equivalent rating,** with analysts at Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Bernstein recently naming it a ""top pick."" **The consensus price target is about $177,** a roughly 18% premium over the chipmaker’s intraday level Monday.

> Bank of America: “We highlight NVDA’s continued dominance in genAI compute and ecosystem, quickly expanding from the cloud all the way to enterprise and consumers. **Maintain Buy on our top sector pick.”**

> Stifel: “Nvidia's announcements today are significant, but long-tailed. We view these developments as further deepening the company's competitive moat and positioning around potentially multi-billion dollar advancements tied to AI agents, robotics, autonomous vehicles, graphics and PC and edge-device inferences in the coming years.”

> Meanwhile, for Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) analysts, key takeaways from the keynote were the introduction of the new RTX 50-series GPUs, the announcement that Blackwell is now in full production, AI scaling expansion, and expectations that the company’s automotive business could grow to around $5 billion by fiscal 2026.

> Lastly, Wedbush analysts said Huang’s CES speech “felt more like a rock concert vibe than a tech CEO speech.”

> “The overriding message from Jensen was a slew of new AI technology is coming out of Nvidia around robotics, autonomous technology, PCs that will further stretch their enormous technology lead vs. the rest of the semi and Big Tech landscape,” analysts noted.

> “This was a major ""flex the muscles"" moment for Nvidia and Jensen in this AI arms race playing out across the tech ecosystem globally.”

> Morgan Stanley lowered its price target for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) from $166 to **$152** on Tuesday, citing investor concerns sparked by the release of DeepSeek’s AI model. 

So if 20 out of 21 analysts maintained a “buy” or equivalent rating with a price target of about $177 before CES, Benchmark  and Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating with a $190 price target after CES, and even now Morgan Stanley says it has a price target of $152...

Then why did Wall Street sell NVDA from ~$142 down to ~$118?  

Are we to believe that Wall Street, with all their analysts, researchers, and quants, decided at a drop of a hat to ignore their own price targets and dump what they themselves described as an undervalued stock, or are they seeing something that retail isn't yet pricing in?

> The universe is no narrow thing and the order within it is not constrained by any latitude in its conception to repeat what exists in one part in any other part. Even in this world more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there, like a string in a maze, so that you shall not lose your way. For existence has its own order and that no man's mind can compass, that mind itself being but a fact among others.

Microsoft and OpenAI Probing If DeepSeek-Linked Group Improperly Obtained OpenAI Data,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-29/microsoft-probing-if-deepseek-linked-group-improperly-obtained-openai-data,"> Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI are investigating whether data output from OpenAI’s technology was obtained in an unauthorized manner by a group linked to Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek, according to people familiar with the matter.

> Microsoft’s security researchers in the fall observed individuals they believe may be linked to DeepSeek exfiltrating a large amount of data using the OpenAI application programming interface, or API, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Software developers can pay for a license to use the API to integrate OpenAI’s proprietary artificial intelligence models into their own applications.

> Microsoft, an OpenAI technology partner and its largest investor, notified OpenAI of the activity, the people said. Such activity could violate OpenAI’s terms of service or could indicate the group acted to remove OpenAI’s restrictions on how much data they could obtain, the people said.

> DeepSeek earlier this month released a new open-source artificial intelligence model called R1 that can mimic the way humans reason, upending a market dominated by OpenAI and US rivals such as Google and Meta Platforms Inc. The Chinese upstart said R1 rivaled or outperformed leading US developers’ products on a range of industry benchmarks, including for mathematical tasks and general knowledge — and was built for a fraction of the cost. The potential threat to the US firms’ edge in the industry sent technology stocks tied to AI, including Microsoft, Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., tumbling on Monday, erasing a total of almost $1 trillion in market value.

> David Sacks, President Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence czar, said Tuesday there’s “substantial evidence” that DeepSeek leaned on the output of OpenAI’s models to help develop its own technology. In an interview with Fox News, Sacks described a technique called distillation whereby one AI model uses the outputs of another for training purposes to develop similar capabilities.

> “There’s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled knowledge out of OpenAI models and I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this,” Sacks said, without detailing the evidence.

> In a statement responding to Sacks’ comments, OpenAI didn’t directly address his comments about DeepSeek. “We know PRC based companies — and others — are constantly trying to distill the models of leading US AI companies,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in the statement, referring to the People’s Republic of China. “As the leading builder of AI, we engage in countermeasures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models, and believe as we go forward that it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.”",2025-01-29 03:16:58,2362,574,wallstreetbets

DeepSeek training cost - the $95 mil difference,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1icdu1d/deepseek_training_cost_the_95_mil_difference/,"I’m sure all dip buyers & bears are already tired of hearing about DeepSeek. But let’s settle one thing before we move on.

 

**Analysis of Training Cost (Total Cost of Ownership)**

What does it cost for country to launch a satellite into space? The cost to *rent* the rocket, or to build it?

If Madagascar announced they **RENTED** a spot on SpaceX dragon for $2.75 mil, your reaction is probably not “HOLY SHIT sell all space stocks / NASA is cooked / Madagascar is catching up!” **No, you’d be impressed if they BUILT the rocket for 27x cheaper than the US and launched it.**

 

**DeepSeek’s reported $5.6 Mil Cost is Rental, NOT TCO ($100 MIL):**

https://preview.redd.it/lijfzqle5tfe1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aed30ab7f2608a03eedf41aa867f87c1f9181c9

The **$5.6 million figure (*****rental cost!*****)** being thrown around to train DeepSeek-v3 doesn’t paint the whole picture. I’ll include this excerpt from Leopold A.’s (former OpenAI researcher) Situational Awareness essay when discussing ***total cost of ownership*** for training AI models:

https://preview.redd.it/yd6j5jaf5tfe1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=93526f2445c76fe774bf39aaf355203b5025ca89

Using Leopold's napkin math… the 40% ratio of GPU purchase cost (2,000 H800s = $45 mil) ***equates to \~$100 million to stand up a cluster needed to train DeepSeek v3!***

https://preview.redd.it/xdokt7qj5tfe1.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a6791b661099a6c485d41262005c395ef18710f

These numbers also don’t include paying the AI researchers (not cheap), failed training runs, and data collection costs which are significant.

**Yes, \~$100 mil is 5x cheaper than \~500 mil it took for training ChatGPT4.** **But acting like 3 guys in their basement cooked up a competitor to OpenAI for some hedge fund pocket change ($5.6 mil) is categorically false.**

Nvidia’s $590 Billion DeepSeek Rout Is Largest in Market History,https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-deepseek-sets-off-ai-market-rout-2025-01-27/,"ALTERNATIVE SOURCE — Bloomberg: Nvidia Corp.’s plunge, fueled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the world’s largest company. 

Nvidia shares tumbled 17% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020, erasing $589 billion from the company’s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record — a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value — and was the biggest in US stock-market history. 

The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Monday’s slump, Nvidia selloffs have caused eight of the top ten biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell 1.5% Monday and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3%.

The semiconductor maker led a broader selloff in technology stocks after DeepSeek’s low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing artificial intelligence. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price. 

The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Apple Inc.’s App Store rankings. 

“Concerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,” Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients.

Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because they design semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that aren’t showing a sufficient return on the investment. 

Meta announced plans on Friday to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as $65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. announcing a $100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centers and AI infrastructure projects around the US. 

In a bid to stall China’s progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeek’s progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources.

Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek’s model is an “excellent AI advancement” and indicated that the Chinese company didn’t violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, requires “requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.”

NVDA’s DeepSeek Sell-Off: This Is a Jevons Paradox Buying Opportunity,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ib9u95/nvdas_deepseek_selloff_this_is_a_jevons_paradox/,"NVIDIA (NVDA) is down hard, dropping from $142 to $126 pre-market after hype around DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup achieving more with less compute. The market fears efficient AI models will hurt GPU demand, but this reaction misses the bigger picture.

Why This Is Bullish Long-Term

	1.	Jevons Paradox: Efficiency doesn’t reduce demand—it increases it. As AI becomes cheaper and more accessible, more businesses, startups, and individuals will adopt it, driving more GPU sales.

	2.	New Markets: Efficient models mean more local AI deployments (edge computing) and new industries adopting AI. NVIDIA’s products (DGX, Jetson, RTX GPUs) are perfectly positioned for this shift.

	3.	Redistribution, Not Decline: The demand for AI is evolving, not shrinking. NVIDIA will sell to thousands of smaller players, adding to their hyperscaler business.

	4.	Software Moat: CUDA and TensorRT ensure NVIDIA stays at the center of AI workflows, even as the market shifts.

At $126, this is classic overreaction. AI isn’t slowing—it’s expanding. NVDA is still the backbone of the industry, and this dip is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.

TL;DR: DeepSeek highlights AI’s growth, not NVIDIA’s decline. Efficiency drives broader adoption, and NVDA’s hardware/software dominance makes them a winner. Thoughts? Buying the dip?

Update: NVDA dropped to $116.94 at its lowest point today. Making it the largest one day drop of any stock, almost 600 Billion. Good luck regards. ",2025-01-27 14:05:55,1977,828,wallstreetbets
Sell side analyst notes on NVDA this morning,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ib9lud/sell_side_analyst_notes_on_nvda_this_morning/,"BofA: 'DeepSeek Concerns Overblown in AI Semis; but Foundational Models Keep Demand High'

 ""On January 20, China-based AI lab DeepSeek created a mini-flurry in the AI semiconductor space by releasing a free, open-source R1 model that reportedly outperforms leading Western AI models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4. The model's creators claimed it took only two months and less than $6 million to build using older-generation NVIDIA H800 chips.

If accurate, this advancement suggests model usefulness and accuracy might not scale directly with compute/memory/networking, potentially reducing the demand for expensive AI chips. However, we believe this concern about slowing AI scaling is overstated. Based on available data, DeepSeek's model appears to be a 'distilled' model relying on larger foundation models like Meta's open-source Llama.

It is these foundational LLMs where significant and rising infrastructure costs are incurred, as evidenced by Meta's plan to raise CY25E capex by over 56% year-over-year to $60-$65 billion. In our view, we will continue to see increasing compute demand driven by a mix of large foundational models (both proprietary and open-source), derivative models (leveraging techniques such as knowledge distillation, sparse attention, and low-rank factorization), and inference at scale across diverse cloud, enterprise, and sovereign AI customers.

We maintain our Buy ratings on NVIDIA (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Marvell Technology (MRVL).""

JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande: ""Investors are concerned that rather than impede China's progress in AI, the US restrictions have engendered innovation that has enabled the development of a model that prioritises efficiency. ... The news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of Microsoft, which is spending $80bn in '25, while Meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn. Open AI also announced that the Stargate project intends to invest $500m over the next four years building new AI infrastructure in the US. Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek's highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible."" 

Jefferies analyst Edison Lee: ""Re-evaluating computing power needs could cause 2026 AI Capex to fall (or not grow)...We believe DS's success could drive two possible industry strategies: 1) still pursue more computing power to drive even faster model improvements, and 2) refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026."" 

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon: ""Is DeepSeek doomsday for AI buildouts? We don't think so...we believe that 1) DeepSeek DID NOT ""build OpenAI for $5M""; 2) the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and 3) the resulting Twitterverse panic over the weekend seems overblown."" Though Rasgon acknowledged DeepSeek's models are good. The analyst kept his outperform ratings on Nvidia and Broadcom, advising clients not to buy into the doomsday scenarios. 

Citi analyst Malik: ""While the dominance of the US companies on the most advanced AI models could be potentially challenged, that said, we estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US' access to more advanced chips is an advantage. Thus, we don't expect leading AI companies would move away from more advanced GPUs."" Malik maintained a buy rating on Nvidia . 

Raymond James' semiconductor analyst Srini Pajjuri: ""If DeepSeek's innovations are adopted broadly, an argument can be made that model training costs could come down significantly even at U.S. hyperscalers, potentially raising questions about the need for 1-million XPU/GPU clusters as projected by some...: A more logical implication is that DeepSeek will drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers to leverage their key advantage (access to GPUs) to distance themselves from cheaper alternatives."" Pajjuri reiterated buy ratings on Nvidia and ASML. 

Cantor analyst C.J. Muse: ""Following release of DeepSeek's V3 LLM, there has been great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs. We think this view is farthest from the truth and that the announcement is actually very bullish with AGI seemingly closer to reality and Jevons Paradox almost certainly leading to the AI industry wanting more compute, not less."" Muse said buy Nvidia on any weakness.",2025-01-27 13:55:01,146,102,wallstreetbets

My loss of 2024,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iatjmu,"The word of the day is greed. I started trading options this year (2024) and this is how it went. 
Messed around with some small cap calls lost 100% on some and made 300% on others. my eyes grew big I had no idea you could make 300% off a stock moving 5 or 10%. 
I went HEAVEY into Dd around June and would stay up all night sometimes just to loose the next day but I never gave up. One day around September when they did the rate cuts I heard the news bought in Nvidia and QQQ calls right before close. They both gapped up the next day. I traded on that market open ended up making quite a few trades turned $200 into 5000 in 24 hours.  
I go back to focusing on DD and find my next opportunity.  I remember trading other things making too many trades. Started drinking a lot wishing everyday could be like that day. My account goes down to 2,000. I put everything into Tesla calls right before earnings and my sober mind set up the play where I could buy 100 shares of Tesla at 230 for just 1800 dollars. How? Well Tesla was at 216 and had record sells so I bought a weekly 230 and 13 weekly 240s. I’ll be damned if that plan didn’t work out. But my paper handing ass sold at market open and fucked it all up.  That’s where the downward spiral started. 

In the next trading week 

I went all in on qqq calls 1 dte and it tanked the next day. Anyways after that trade (late October) I went on a downward spiral and a pretty bad one. Almost lost everything. 
(Not just money but my family, house, business). 
I was drinking way to much to cope with the pain was my excuse. but on Christmas I put it down haven’t drank since. Everyday I do dd on company’s and watch the charts. plan my next move also started reading the intelligent investor that Warren buffet recommends. This year will be different I can feel it.

"Intel will be the surprise overperformer in 2025, starting with the 1/30 ER.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i70b11/intel_will_be_the_surprise_overperformer_in_2025/,"Before I start, I want to preface this by acknowledging the memes and negative connection between intel and the one guy who lost his grandma's funds, but I genuinely believe with how low st. expectations are, combined with intel's massive sell-off these few months, Intel will skyrocket leading up/during the ER @ 1/30/2025.

# 1. Extremely heavy Investments in Manufacturing

* **Tens of Billions Invested**: Intel has invested heavily in manufacturing expansion, aiming to regain technological leadership. These investments are expected to start bearing fruit by 2026 and 2027, positioning Intel as a key U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturer.
   * Now I know ya'll are gonna complain, but that's 2026 and 2027, which is a long ways out! Here's the thing, as long as (they will) Intel acknowleges their progress towards manufacturing, and the expected returns of their investments, especially under the current administration, the upside will be more or less priced in within the report.
* **Alignment with U.S. Government Priorities**: U.S. policy encourages domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, especially with the new Mango administration.
   * It's pretty obvious that the current admin wants to become less dependent on foreign semiconductor manufacturing, and Intel's investments in the space PLUS mango being in power will undoubtedly be great for the stock, and I believe that's what Intel will lean into heavily during the upcoming earnings report with stellar guidance.

# 2. Undervalued Stock Price

* **Current Valuation**: Intel is trading at one of its lowest forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios of the year, at around 20.
* **Intrinsic Value**: Updated discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation indicates an intrinsic value of $36 per share, significantly higher than the current trading price of $19.82. While there may be some other factors, this suggests Intel is trading on a pretty steep discount compared to its market value, way less than other big names.

# 3. Advanced Developments

* **Advanced Node Development**: Intel is investing in advanced manufacturing nodes to close the gap with competitors like TSMC and Samsung. Success in these nodes will make Intel competitive in high-margin markets.
   * I'll admit, I'm not entirely familiar with the development process of these, but I can't imagine this not being bullish for the stock.
* **Gaudi AI Chips**: The release of competitive AI chips (e.g., Gaudi 3) positions Intel to capture a share of the rapidly growing AI market.

# 4. Reduced Competition in Dual Design-Manufacturing Model

* **Unique Positioning**: Intel and Micron remain the only U.S.-based companies pursuing both design and manufacturing, while most competitors focus on design alone. This vertical integration could yield huge advantages as Intel scales.
   * Again, I'm not familiar with the development of chips, but from what I could find, if Intel could pull this off in the long-run, it'll set itself in an extremely unique environment with both design and manufacturing WITHIN the United States. Would be huge for the nation-first agenda under the current administration.

# 5. Support from Geopolitical Tailwinds

* **CHIPS Act Benefits**: Intel is set to benefit from U.S. government incentives under the CHIPS Act, including grants and tax credits for domestic semiconductor manufacturing.
   * Again, huge for a US-based company like Intel.

# 6. Potential Leadership Turnaround

* **CEO Transition**: A change in leadership could bring new strategic clarity and execution capability, particularly in aligning investment timelines with profitability goals.
   * Though Pat was a pretty chill guy, if Intel could bring in someone with large amounts of industry experience, that's another huge upside potential for Intel. They may announce a new CEO during ER or somewhere near it, but I just can't imagine them settling with a mid-tier guy after what they've been through.

# 7. Market Share Opportunities

* **Competitor Weaknesses**: AMD and Nvidia focus on niche areas, leaving room for Intel to grow in data centers, personal computing, and automotive applications.
   * Yes, this does mean that their areas would be very hard to break into, but we've already seen Intel turning around in some aspects, especially their newer desktop gaming GPUs which actually bring in surprising value for performance beyond AMD and Nvidia comparable cards.
* **U.S. Government Contracts**: Intel’s U.S.-based manufacturing advantage makes it a preferred supplier for defense and other government projects, which is yet another large catalyst for the future.

# 8. Focused Financial Discipline

* **Cost Reductions**: Intel has paused dividends and reduced workforce to save over $10 billion by 2025, stabilizing its financial position during this investment-heavy period.
   * I expect to see this being reflected upon in the upcoming 1/30 ER. With a bit more cash freed up and stabilizing finances, I'm pretty confident that it'll be far beyond what the market has been pricing in which is arguably a worst case doomsday scenario.

# Conclusion

Yes, Intel does have a decent amount of debt. Yes, nana's son did lose hundreds of thousands. But it's objectively true that INTC has been beaten down mercilessly these past few months, with a 56% drawdown since the start of 2024. It's entirely possible- likely even- that this is a far overreaction, especially with INTC taking steps to improve leadership, control debts, free up cash, and invest in what's needed. Combine that with the new administration that went into power yesterday, focusing on heavy domestic production, I believe Intel will be the surprise overperformer for this year.

NFA. I hold around $10k in calls expiring next month after the ER, and I am planning on DCAing aggressively into shares to hold for a few years.

TLDR: Grandma died 8 years ago. Left me nothing. So I invested my own money. 

Here's why I like Intel:

* 2024 Q1 up 9% YOY
* Intel has been heavily investing and restructuring by building out the domestic foundry business to manufacture semiconductor chips for third party companies.
* With Intel 3 in production, leading-edge semiconductors are being manufactured in the US for the first time in a decade. Intel will regain process leadership as the Intel Foundry continues to grow.
* I think the fact that Intel is positioning itself to be the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US is massive. The US Gov is heavily prioritizing domestic semiconductor production and thus is heavily supporting Intel as a company with R&D funding.
* If NVIDIA or AMD are ever forced to change manufacturers due to rising tensions/war between China & Taiwan, Intel will likely be a sole or largest manufacturer for NVIDIA and AMD
* Intel has been heavily investing in R&D. 5.9B out of 12.7B of Q124 revenue was invested in R&D.
* Intel is on track to exceed its forecast of 40 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2024
* The Intel Gaudi 3AI accelerator is projected to deliver 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than NVIDIA H100 on leading AI models.
* Trading at Forward PE of 17.05
* Geopolitical tensions will ultimately work in Intel's favor more than any other company in this industry
* I like the stock and I think its really cheap rn :)",2025-01-21 21:13:23,4213,857,wallstreetbets

TSM Earnings: Is AVGO's 2024 Revenue Quadrupling to $90B? The Signs Point to YES!,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i2ptxt/tsm_earnings_is_avgos_2024_revenue_quadrupling_to/,"Broadcom (AVGO) is on the verge of an explosion, and it's all thanks to AI. Their recent earnings call wasn't just good; it was a game-changer. **And guess what? TSM's latest earnings call just confirmed everything!**

CEO Hock Tan predicts AVGO's AI chip market (XPUs and networking) could reach **$60 BILLION to $90 BILLION by 2027**! That's up from around $12 billion today. We're talking about a potential **4x increase or more** – the same kind of growth that made Nvidia what it is today.

**Here's the key:**

* **TSM Confirms the Trend:** TSM, the world's leading chip manufacturer and a key supplier for Broadcom, reported HUGE demand for AI chips in their recent earnings call 

>we now forecast the revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period starting off the already higher base of 2024. We expect AI accelerator to be the strongest driver of our HPC platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of our overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. 

* This is a major indicator that the AI chip boom is REAL and Broadcom is in the right place at the right time.
* **Hyperscaler Demand:** Three major cloud companies (hyperscalers) are driving this growth, and Broadcom is working with two more.
* **Custom Chips are King:** Google's Gemini uses Broadcom's custom chips (TPUs). This proves that specialized chips are essential for large-scale AI. Off-the-shelf just won't cut it.
* **VMware Integration:** The VMware acquisition is successful and profitable.
* **Broadcom's Expertise:** They're the best at designing and making these custom AI chips.

Broadcom is positioned to dominate the AI chip market, just like Nvidia. The growth won't be overnight, but the long-term potential is massive.

Here's the kicker: AVGO's revenue could potentially quadruple, yet the stock price is only up around 20% in the past month! **This means there's a HUGE gap between the potential future value and the current price.** AVGO is seriously undervalued right now.

**TL;DR:** AVGO is about to become a major player in the AI chip market. $60-90 billion in potential revenue by 2027 (possibly 4x growth or more), driven by custom chip demand from big cloud companies. TSM's earnings call confirms this is happening NOW. **The stock price hasn't caught up to the potential yet, meaning there's a lot of room to grow.** This could be the next NVDA.",2025-01-16 14:15:04,38,32,wallstreetbets

SERV's food delivery robots will fail and I can prove it,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i252rn/servs_food_delivery_robots_will_fail_and_i_can/,"https://preview.redd.it/bofd5uleb7de1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecd1178ed4bda7f8ef6c000f100fb769464dd705

You thought it would be because of crackheads and homeless people? Nope, those are the least of Serve Robotics' worries. 



The company has a history of not only being unprofitable, but also having negative gross margins. That's REALLY bad, the cost of operating their robots is higher than the revenue generated from them. It's the equivalent of buying high and selling low, I'm sure you regards are familiar with that.

This would be fine if the company focused on improving the robot's efficiency, autonomy and costs until they can demonstrate potential future profitability...

But instead, this year they suddenly decided to start manufacturing 2000 of their 3rd generation robot. That's a 20x increase from their current fleet of 100 robots. These robots cost more to produce than an average car, this sudden ramp up will put a lot of financial pressure on the company. The CEO's reasoning: this mass production contract will help drive the robot's cost down.



*By the way, did you know their robots are actually remote controlled with a PS5 controller 20% of the time?*

[From SERV's 10-K 2023 SEC filing](https://preview.redd.it/q3zaju5vb7de1.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1aac7002652983d323481aaf88297d549d30988)

Anyways, let's run the numbers down. Don't skip to the TLDR yet I'll try to make it interesting.

What we want to figure out is a future projection of:

* a robot's average yearly revenue
* its associated yearly costs as well as production costs
* calculate the years it takes to get a return on investment

Let's first take a look at their fleet's current revenue.

[From SERV's latest quarterly report](https://preview.redd.it/67fawqkec7de1.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=02b62e9a6900fd04f87a36d1891284e6161d91f0)

Extrapolated yearly, that's $450k in delivery revenue generated by the robots. But how many robots were active during that period?

https://preview.redd.it/hligx3cic7de1.png?width=559&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c085ee410181ab38760de0fc31c6f685e272444

The ""daily supply hours"" indicate a daily runtime of about 8h per robot. 

On average, 59 daily active robots. Extrapolating the quarterly data, that gives us an average yearly delivery revenue per robot of... **$7612**.



Does that sound bad? We haven't even looked at the cost of operating each of these robots, and just comparing that yearly revenue to the manufacturing cost of the robot makes you question how they could ever reach profitability. 



I dug into their [SEC filings](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1832483/000121390024018566/ea0200355ex10-16_serverobot.htm) and found out their current 2nd generation robots cost them **$63,654** each. It's very unsurprising the CEO never talks about that number in any of his numerous interviews. It would currently take a robot 8 years to gain enough delivery revenue to pay back its initial production cost.



We haven't even talked about the cost of revenue yet, Is it already all over for Serve robotics? No, remember, what we're interested in is a projection of their future profitability. 



According to the company, their 3rd gen delivery robots that will begin manufacturing will have more battery autonomy, higher top speeds (up to 11mph, looking forward to the inevitable accidents and lawsuits), and a production cost per robot slashed by half.



I booted up excel and ran the numbers. Considering the delivery revenue efficiency per robot hours barely went up between 2023 and 2024, I'm projecting a charitable improved daily robot runtime (currently at 8h) and delivery efficiency increase based on the new gen robot specs. Also accounting for the halved robot cost ($32,000):

[values are per robot](https://preview.redd.it/ckldrv0dd7de1.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=02a0c75367a05a732cf3623d50ffea942aa52f83)

Not looking great...

And I'm not done, lets get to the fun part! Expenses.



These are the expenses that directly scale with the number of robots:

* **Robot remote control and monitoring:**

As I've mentioned before, the robots need to be remote controlled 20% of the time to navigate ""complicated"" situations like intersection crossings. For a robot daily uptime of 10 hours, that's 2 hours of human work time. In reality, more than 2 hours would be necessary as the amount of robots needing human control at the same time will spike. Let's go with 2.5 hours as a conservative estimate. At a rate of 20$/hour, that's... $18,250 spent yearly per robot. 

* **Robot repairs and maintenance:**

Yearly robot repairs and maintenance typically amount to 10 to 20% of their initial cost. Considering SERV's robots operate outside, sometimes under rain and other bad conditions, their maintenance costs are probably higher but let's use the conservative estimate of 10%, so $3200 per year.



Those are the two biggest expenses, I'll ignore mobile internet costs (each robot livestreams video feed to human operators), the cost to physically help the robot when it gets toppled over, energy cost to repair batteries, etc.



Before we get to the final projection, it's important to take into account a secondary revenue source for their robots: advertisement revenue. Ads they stick on the sides and top of the robot. I chose an estimate of $800 a month per robot in ad revenue. For reference, full car wrap ad services typically pay at maximum $400/month.



And here we have the final projection:

[values are per robot](https://preview.redd.it/4gr0dcn7e7de1.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab2493adeaa67574b7f9950de2da425b3b5f31ce)

Even with the most charitable projection, 6 years to recoup the robot's production cost is way too long to be profitable. The robot's lifespan might not even exceed 5 years. The real cost of operating the robots will also very likely be much higher than my estimation.

# A bit of history

SERV is currently valued at over 1 billion dollars. When it IPOed, at the beginning of 2024, it was priced at a valuation of 100 Million, and its stock quickly dropped by half once it hit the market. Since then, it diluted its shares by more than 2x. 

So why did the stock massively pump 2000% in the middle of the year? That happened after the reveal of NVIDIA's $12M investment (at the time, 10% ownership) in the company. 

NVIDIA's venture capital arm ([Nventures](https://www.nventures.ai/)), invested in the company back in 2022. It invests in all sorts of innovative AI companies who use their products. NVIDIA has a vested interest in the company successfully operating autonomous delivery robots, it's great advertisement for their Jetson modules and the advancement of AI. That does not mean NVIDIA believes or really cares that much about the company being able to generate a profit.

# My prediction

The 2000 robots, all supposedly manufactured during 2025, will cost the company an initial 60 million dollars. As the robots begin operating, costs will balloon 20 times over and revenue won't catch up. Serve Robotics will continue bleeding money at a much faster pace, and will keep diluting shares. Insiders started selling a lot of shares in the past 2 months ($3M). I expect it might take a while for the price to correct itself, but considering how overvalued SERV is right now I'm confident in shorting it and I expect it to drop during future financial reports.

Covered calls strategies on Nvida with ultra-low cost-base,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i1i2d5/covered_calls_strategies_on_nvida_with_ultralow/,"So, I’m holding about 900 shares of Nvidia (sub $5 cost base, flexing a bit here), and I'm thinking about selling some covered calls to pocket that sweet, sweet premium without getting totally wrecked by JPOW. I'm still mega bullish on NVDA long-term – the tendy god ain’t going anywhere – but with a market cap of $3.3T, I’m not exactly expecting the moon every single day and I wouldn't mind taking some profits (tax-free btw). At some point, the unlimited 10-bag machine has to stop right?

Right now, Nvidia is about 30% of my portfolio, which is a little spicy and why I feel comfortable selling CCs on roughly half of my position. If I sell covered calls, I’m okay with getting assigned at my chosen price, but I've learned from the regards here that I should close as soon as I see 50% profit and re-roll.

Here’s where I need some regarded wisdom: how do you choose the right strike price/date for max premium and min risk? I’ve heard mixed opinions — some say weeklies are the move, others swear by monthlies. Most people target a delta around 0.1 - 0.15 to avoid getting called out too early. And then there’s the whole debate about when to enter… I’m hearing you want to avoid selling on red days, before earnings, or when a major news drop is coming.

So what’s your game plan? Do you use technicals like the 50/100/200 day averages? Do you wait for that magic “X% daily gain” before pulling the trigger? Hit me with your most regarded strategies, I’m here for all of it and ready to lose money with you.

NBIS - Picks & Shovels but make it AI,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i1dgr6/nbis_picks_shovels_but_make_it_ai/,"TL:DR :

* Company makes infrastructure for AI workloads at extremely impressive efficiency levels. Proprietary configuration for GPU clusters (first in NA to complete in Q1), has efficiency levels and compute performance beyond that of Tesla's latest creation, which NVDA Jensen said described as remarkable. Tip of the iceberg
* $700 mil invested by NVIDIA, who is supplying H100 Hopper GPUs for their cluster models with the first being constructed in KC, with plans to integrate Blackwell GPU H2 2025.
* Minimal debt totaling $27mil with a near $2bil in cash, $1bil+ planned infrastructure development in 25', with ARR forecast of $750m-1b

Primary focus is not some unremarkable data processing system that every SV chump and his grandma are pushing down throats. Nebius was sitting on some already profitable infrastructure in Finland and decided they could expand, replicate and improve across Europe and North America.

They were able to secure listing on the NASDAQ, and quickly obtained a $700 mil investment from Nvidia. Contrary to the few posts from your normal run of the mill bullshit like Motley fool etc..., this part on it's own is actually meaningless. Companies the size on Nvidia throw hail mary's at startups all the time and don't blink when they fail. However, in the context of their lofty development goals, this was their entry point to securing the hardware they needed to succeed, of which there is a finite supply.

Nebius plans to house 35,000 GPU's upon completion of the KC facility (20,000 by year end), utilizing the latest and incredibly efficient NVIDIA H200 GPUs

Alongside this, their facility in Finland is getting an overhaul and expansion, and a new facility will be constructed in Paris.

This is early days, P/S incredibly low in the peer group, which is insane considering the ridiculous multiples on all of the other shit doing nothing in this space. Industry trends are a massive tail wind. If they stay true to growth projections it's only a matter of time before it balloons, and Q1 is an excellent test of their reliance and ability to meet targets.

They received their first buy rating today from some garage shop trying to play wallstreet dress-up, but institutional money is going to be eyeing this closely, and they have an added advantage of their global footprint for managers looking to reposition this far into the secular bull.

As far as revenue goes, they reported $43 million in Q3 2024. They anticipate ARR to surpass $700 mil by year end. If we want to keep valuations reasonable relative to peers, this company should be valued well above 15 billion by year end, making a $65 share price entirely reasonable as the market plays catch-up.

While searching for appropriate contracts, I discovered zero liquidity on every prominent strike from this week until 2027. On Jan 9th open interest spiked an hour into close across most 40, 45, and 50 strikes. Begun building a position here and will continue to do so as I raise cash.

NTDOY as NVDA play,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/01/13/the-nintendo-switch-2-may-have-an-imminent-reveal-date-says-new-report/,"Hear me out. Nintendo's new console, likely to be called the Nintendo Switch 2 to my great disappointment, is looking more and more likely to be announced this week.

We know for an absolute fact that the new system will use NVIDIA Tegra T239 for moar power.

""This chip focuses on improved ray tracing cores, faster memory and AI performance. With an Ampere chip and a reported 12GB of RAM, the Switch 2 could employ Nintendo’s take on DLSS or Nvidia’s upscaling technology.""

interesting Forbes article: What Nvidia’s CEO Missed About Quantum Computing,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hye4di/interesting_forbes_article_what_nvidias_ceo/,"Just found this Forbes article by Jason Snyder about the tangible value quantum computing is already delivering today. I thought so. The whole downwards hysteria is grossly exaggerated. AI will flourish to the maximum with the help of quantum computing which already is in massive use by many (big) companies.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonsnyder/2025/01/09/quantum-is-decades-away-not-so-fast/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonsnyder/2025/01/09/quantum-is-decades-away-not-so-fast/)

Here is an excerpt: 

""Quantum computing is not 30 years away—it’s already transforming industries by solving problems classical systems can’t. The technology is advancing rapidly. Hybrid quantum-classical systems are bridging the gap, delivering tangible results while paving the way for broader adoption.

The Real Game Changer: Quantum + AI

While quantum computing excels at optimization, pairing it with artificial intelligence unlocks even more potential. AI is adept at pattern recognition and predictive modeling but struggles with computational bottlenecks when dealing with massive datasets. Quantum computing eliminates these barriers, accelerating AI’s capabilities.

Quantum-enhanced AI can:

* Train faster by processing large datasets in parallel.
* Make predictions with greater precision by evaluating all potential outcomes simultaneously.
* Solve previously intractable problems, such as hyper-personalizing real-time customer experiences.

For businesses, this means AI models trained on quantum-optimized data can uncover insights that drive more accurate, impactful decision-making. 

**Experiment with Quantum Platforms**: Cloud-based tools like D-Wave’s Leap or IBM’s Qiskit make it easy to test quantum algorithms without significant investments.""  

Doesn't sound bad to me...

Robotics stocks will be the next wave of hypergrowth,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hxl8m4/robotics_stocks_will_be_the_next_wave_of/,"Hi regards. Since markets are closed today and we're all bored as fuck, I'm gonna drop some insight on all y'all that want to gamble away your mortgages and college tuitions.

We've seen a few trends over the last few months where some previously-beat-up tickers went from trash to gold. I'm gonna call this trend ""shit we thought we'd have in the future because we watched a lot of sci-fi movies"". 2024 was the year of AI, then it was the space stocks (RKLB, LUNR, etc). Then it was the flying car stocks (ARCH, JOBY, etc). Then we all saw the quantum stock bubble (though any regard with a CS degree could have told you the same thing that Jensen did). So, what sci-fi future shit is left to invest in? Robots, obviously!

Except, robots, like space rockets, are real. And they're already in market and getting better rapidly. 2025 is the year when they'll really start to go mainstream, largely because software is the biggest limiting factor to how good robots are today. With recent advancements in AI, robots are going to start getting \*A LOT\* better.

Further supporting my bullish thesis is NVIDIA's recent release of their Cosmos Wold Foundation Model  (https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-cosmos-world-foundation-model-platform-to-accelerate-physical-ai-development). Why is this a big deal? because, this will really lower the cost of entry for the robot manufacturers as they won't have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to train a vision model by themselves. Now they can just equip their bots with some commodity sensors & cameras and build out the hardware bot for their use case.

Positions:

Due to market-cap requirements here, the only one I can mention is SERV - holding 2000 shares and 20 LEAP contracts for May.

Buying the RGTI Dip? Stop. Think. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hwpbpx/buying_the_rgti_dip_stop_think/,"People hyping up the dip on RGTI seem to be ignoring the elephant in the room: a single, casual comment about quantum computing from a tech CEO wiped out 50% of RGTI's share price overnight. Let that sink in for a second... half the market cap gone, not because of earnings, not because of product failures, but because of words.

Now ask yourself: what does that say about what was propping up the $18+ price? Spoiler: It wasn’t the underlying financials or fundamentals.

So why are you buying back in? Are you seriously betting that Jensen walks back his comment? Or are you hoping another big-name CEO decides to contradict him just to boost this stock? Because that's a pretty wild gamble when you think about it.

This isn’t about a calculated investment anymore... it’s about FOMO and denial. Some of you don’t seem to want your money. Just remember, markets can stay irrational a lot longer than your wallet can.

TL;DR: Be real with yourself before buying the RGTI dip. Is this a strategic play, or are you just coping?

Edit#1 for clarification:

Clearly a divisive topic. Appreciate you all engaging and thanks for the award.

I’m seeing a lot of replies suggesting I’m bearish on quantum’s long-term potential. For clarity, I’m not. My point is that even at this dip, RGTI’s price doesn’t reflect its fundamentals or actual progress. If you believe in RGTI’s future, that’s fine... but why not wait for a price that matches its current reality?

If your plan is to time and profit off a dead cat bounce, great. Just be clear on your strategy.

Edit#2 for context some are missing:

For the multitude of comments claiming this was a ploy by Jensen to slow-roll Quantum investments... under Huang's leadership, NVIDIA has established strategic partnerships with multiple quantum computing entities, contributing significantly to the progress of quantum technologies through its high-performance computing solutions.

Quantum stocks today,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hwnjh2/quantum_stocks_today/,"Quantum stocks have plummeted today due to Jensen Huangs speech. He said that quantum computing is still 15-30 years away. 

I agree with this statement but not entirely. I think quantum computing is closer than we think. Personally I think Jensen Huang is saying this out of fear. NVIDIA will become obsolete once quantum computing truly hits the market. The power of quantum computing is incomparable compared to GPU’s. 

I think this dip is a great opportunity to buy going into the future.

The issue with GPU’s is the amount of energy they need to work. Which is why people are drawn to companies like OKLO or SMR to solve this energy issue. But quantum computing will be super efficient reducing the massive need for all this energy.

But yes there is still an energy problem regardless. The grid is growing day by day as people switch to more sustainable methods, EV’s etc.

To conclude I think quantum computing is the future and I am bullish on quantum stocks.

The current U.S. stock market valuation has reached 2000 and 2021 levels.  Will this time be different?,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hv91vx/the_current_us_stock_market_valuation_has_reached/,"Three different U.S. stock market valuation models (the Buffett Indicator, CAPE ratio, and Mean Reversion Model - three different ways of objectively looking at the overall valuation of the current market) are flashing extreme overvaluation warning signs that were both last seen in 2000 and 2021.  Both 2000 and 2021 marked market euphoria highs, and bear markets followed.  You can make all your jokes that you want about gay bears successfully calling 420 of the last 69 recessions or what not, but the undeniable fact is that the track record of these three valuation models showing ""strongly overvalued"" in unison is 2 for 2 in ""calling"" bear markets that followed very quickly.  Will history repeat itself again?  Or is this time different (i.e. - valuations continue to ""not matter"" for longer)?

[Buffett Indicator \(ratio of U.S. stocks total market cap to GDP\) - Strongly overvalued \(2 standard deviations above historical trendline\).

There is also a fourth model - the Interest Rate Model, which measures S&P 500 valuation relative to current 10-year treasury rate.  It hasn't quite hit the ""strongly overvalued"" line (it didn't in 2021 either), but it is pretty close to it.

[Interest Rate Model - Not quite to the \\""strongly overvalued\\"" red line, but close.  Lower than it was in 2000, but higher than it was in 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/32sl4e1o4abe1.jpg?width=1660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dedfffde7edc549734c8c0747c3e3356ceba79bb)

Two recession risk models - Yield Curve Inversion and the Sahm Rule - may be signaling a rough time as well.

\-

There is also the Fed Funds Rate. It is showing a similar setup to previous cycles of rate hikes, followed by rate holds, followed by rate cuts, followed by recession.  The current setup looks similar to 2007-2008 especially.  Will the recession or bear market be cancelled this time with ""mission accomplished - soft landing achieved""?

Here is the inflation-adjusted S&P 500 on a log scale chart.  It has historically gone through a series of ""hot"" periods where the market beats inflation for roughly 15 years (give or take a few years), followed by ""cold"" periods where the market loses to inflation that last 10 years (give or take a few years).  The magnitude and time length of the current ""hot"" period looks like it could be giving way to a ""cold"" period soon if the overall historical cycle is followed.

Last but not least, I'll list a few informal ""Can't you just feel it it in the room?"" type ""blow-off top"" indicators of a potential market top:

1. Tesla stock doubled in price in like 1-2 months on shallow narratives not backed by numbers.  An insane $750 billion market cap to an even more insane $1.5 trillion market cap in 1-2 months on a company earning roughly $13 billion annually (132 P/E ratio right now) and not growing much anymore.  Ludicrous.  Earnings have not exploded in line with stock price, not nearly at all.  I don't care what you TSLA lovers say - your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth.
2. Palantir stock also doubled in price in like 1-2 months, also on shallow narratives not backed by numbers.  Roughly $100 billion to $180 billion market cap with a price-to-SALES ratio going from an insane 30x to an even more insane 67x.  Ludicrous.  And I don't care what you PLTR lovers say - your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth.
3. *\[Removing this point from discussion because AutoMod thought I was breaking rule #8, even though I wasn't.  I pasted it down in the comments section* [*HERE*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hv91vx/comment/m5ssco9/)*.\]*
4. Just the mentality of too many market participants buying ponzi-scheme like assets or money-burning trash companies at all in general, often knowingly.  Like, seriously, why is this even a thing?  What the fuck is wrong with this market?  This shouldn't be happening... like, at all.
5. The great momentum chase of 2024. The theme of the year was to just bid up and crowd into the most popular meme-like line-go-up assets, regardless of fundamentals.  It went into over-drive in November/December, to the point of self-parody.  It has a very end-stage bull market feeling to it.
6. The great AI hype.  Does the potential future of AI justify many of these extreme valuations?  Maybe, but I'm not convinced that there's much upside left near-term.  The only companies making serious money from this so far are Nvidia and the handful of companies selling the AI hardware to other companies that are speculating on it.  And the once rapid progression in generative AI chatbots, picture generators, and video generators seen in 2023 and early 2024 seems to have slowed and hit a bit of a wall in the second half of 2024.

TL;DR - All the warning signs of extreme overvaluation and an incoming bear market are there.  Unlike most other gay bear posts that usually just show one ""warning sign"" chart to make a case, I showed you multiple charts, along with multiple observations.  Whether you choose to ignore them or not depends on how long you think the market will choose to ignore them or not.

Positions: (1) Bent over a table.  (2) Puts on TSLA, PLTR, MSTR, and some other 2024 momentum clown stocks for 2025. Contemplating whether to inverse or to inverse my inverse.

They’ve teamed up with Palantir, which is a HUGE deal. Palantir is one of the top dogs in data analytics and AI, so this partnership could seriously boost BigBear’s capabilities. It also opens doors for more government contracts, which are a major source of revenue. Being a smaller company and getting to work with someone like Palantir is huge.

**2. Acquisition of Pangiam**

BigBear recently acquired a company called Pangiam that specializes in facial recognition and biometric tech. This move strengthens their position in security solutions, especially in areas like airport and border security. With the demand for AI-driven security growing, this could lead to some big opportunities down the road.

**3. Massive Government Contracts**

They’ve already locked in a potential $900 million government contract. That’s not just a lot of money—it’s a massive vote of confidence in their tech. Government contracts are stable, long-term, and show that BigBear is a serious player in the space.

**4. Recent performance**

Latley the stock grew by about 200 presents in the last quarter. and yes it is not the safest option, but this move definitely shows interest by investors.  
Also looking at the analyst rating, gives me more confidence about it.

**5. Insider Ownership**  
Nearly 28 precent of the company is owned by insiders, which is a positive sign. It shows that the leadership team has confidence in the business and is invested in its success. Insider ownership often aligns management's interests with shareholders, which can be reassuring for potential investors.

**Why I Think It’s Worth a Shot**

Yes, BigBear is still unprofitable, but they’re in a high-growth phase, and that’s normal for a company investing heavily in its future. The Palantir partnership, the Pangiam acquisition, and those government contracts all point to a company that’s building a strong foundation.

It feels like one of those plays where, if you get in early and they deliver, the upside could be huge. Of course, there’s risk (like with any small-cap stock), but I’m leaning toward it being worth it.

 **Q3 2024 Highlights** 

* Revenue of $6.8 billion. 18% increase YoY.
* Gross profit of $3.4 billion. 24% increase YoY.
* Operating income of $724 million. 223% increase YoY.

 **Q3 2024 By Segment**

Data Center - 

Net revenue of $3.5 billion. 122% increase YoY.

Operating income of $1.04 billion. 240% increase YoY.

Client -

Net revenue of $1.88 billion. 29% increase YoY.

Operating income of $276 million. 97% increase YoY.

Gaming - 

Net revenue of $462 million. 69% decrease YoY.

Operating income of $12 million. 94% decrease YoY. 

Embedded - 

Net revenue of $927 million. 25% decrease YoY.

Operating income of $372 million. 39% decrease YoY.

**Data Center Growth** \- This is AMD’s fastest growing segment and accounts for roughly 50% of all revenue. This number is going to continue its rapid rise due to key acquisitions and product innovation. Lisa Su estimates the market for data center AI accelerators to grow at a CAGR of 60% until the year 2028. That would value the market at $500 billion for things like CPUs, GPU’s, FPGA’s, and ASIC’s. Obviously, Nvidia currently dominates the market. Despite this, there is room for multiple players and AMD has shown their ability to capture market share. In 2022, they surpassed Intel in both market value and annual revenue, positioning themselves as the clear number two player in the market. I've said it before with companies like Palantir, data is the future and every company needs it. Well in order for a company to have data, you need chips. Everything needs chips. We are still in a small and juvenile market that has massive amounts of room to grow.

**Acquisition of ZT Systems** \- Announced in August 2024, AMD will acquire ZT Systems for $4.9 billion. The deal is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2025. ZT specializes in designing and deploying data center AI computing and storage solutions. This shows the focus and commitment AMD has to their fastest growing segment. 

**Strong Belief in Lisa Su -** Lisa Su is an amazing CEO with a strong desire for excellency. After becoming CEO in 2014, she has completely turned around the company and continues to improve it. Here is a great video to watch of her - [https://youtu.be/8Ve5SAFPYZ8](https://youtu.be/8Ve5SAFPYZ8)

**Conclusion** \- AMD is gaining significant amounts of market share for data centers, a trend that will continue as the market grows. Despite declines in the gaming and embedded segments, the company overall continues to grow revenues. The decline in gaming looks alarming but it makes sense. New gen consoles came out 4 years ago which AMD supplies chips for. Regardless, what I’m focused on here is the data center growth. AMD is innovative and managed extremely well which can be seen by continuously improving operating margins and FCF. This company will continue to become a monster. At a current price of **$125,** I expect this to easily get back to **$200+** in 2025 giving a solid 60% upside.",2025-01-05 19:39:21,592,423,wallstreetbets

"$KULR is massively overvalued because of a deceitful CEO. The DD no one asked for.
",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hrwxcq/kulr_is_massively_overvalued_because_of_a/,"What is KULR's core business model exactly? Providing battery thermal safety solutions, licensing fan AI software that helps suppress vibrations? Selling safe cases for batteries? Or maybe it's the recently announced BTC treasury? Wrong! None of the above. KULR's money making strategy... is to milk YOU! The unsuspecting, highly regarded ""investor"".

And what makes me say that, you ask? Many hours of research spent on New Year that I will detail in this post (yes, I had nothing better to do).

Let's begin by introducing Michael Mo, the CEO and founder of KULR. He did a [reddit AmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/o6iboh/i_am_michael_mo_ceo_of_kulr_technology_our/) right after KULR was listed on the NYSE in 2021, what a nice fellow.  
And right there marks the beginning of a deceitful strategy:

*Heavily embellish accomplishments*, *announce big name ""partners"" or ""collaborators"", whilst obfuscating what the relationship is really about, or what the accomplishment actually is.*

https://preview.redd.it/yxqbg56n8mae1.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=f906d5b6cb11703fc7db1d3ad99cef09516e738f

Surely he has a lot to say and can explain their partnership with Andretti Autosports? Well, no not really:

https://preview.redd.it/us679crs8mae1.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=035443f54cac579a2cc6b0a70e1a15392b4d3e06

What an insightful answer by our CEO Michael Mo!

According [to Andretti](https://andrettiglobal.com/news/2022/10/kulr-technology-group-returns-to-andretti-autosport-for-indianapolis-500-with-marco-andretti/), KULR was their primary sponsor for their INDYCAR program. Even after thorough research, nothing seems to indicate KULR was at any point developing or providing their technology to or in collaboration with Andretti.

Surely Mr. Mo wouldn't lie about that, while KULR was actually just sponsoring Andretti in a marketing deal??

I quickly realized, as I deep dived on KULR's announced accomplishments, partnerships and collaborations, that my research painted a much different story every single time.

https://preview.redd.it/e3wvlunw8mae1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7f34ddbf4a7e8ed7239620962e9afd3cfb62b47

What an impressive list of big name ""Customers"" and ""Partners"" listed in the latest investor presentation! Makes you wonder how they only barely hit 10 Million annual revenue with so many ""Key Clients"". Of course, Mr. Mo never actually goes into detail about who the clients are and what is being sold to them.

Fortunately, I have a lot of time on my hands so let's go into some of those supposed customers and partners.

For many of these companies, I could not find a SINGLE source of information linking them to KULR in any way.

**NASA**

KULR sure do like to mention NASA a lot when talking about their biggest accomplishments. Let's dive into those.

https://preview.redd.it/ip5ioic49mae1.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3d6e5c24aff8ad1d17521f22ca3b4dd967b7b68

In 2019, Leidos was awarded a contract by NASA to help bring supplies to the ISS. Leidos decided to use KULR's technology to... \*drumrolls\* safely store laptop batteries next to each other. KULR storage bags that ensure one of them overheating doesn't overheat the ones next to it.

What else?

In 2020, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, funded by NASA, was in charge of SHERLOC, an analysis instrument, for the upcoming Mars rover mission. The laboratory chose KULR's heatsinks to ensure the lasers and sensors wouldn't overheat. Unfortunately, the SHERLOC instrument ran into technical issues when the rover was deployed on Mars.

In July 2024, KULR landed a battery safety contract for $400k worth up to $2 Million with NASA, for automated battery cell testing. Not bad, but not very noteworthy either when you look at KULR's current $1 Billion market cap.

**SpaceX**

Name dropping SpaceX as a ""partner"" is a straight up lie.

KULR will, for the first time ever, in **2026**, have their battery in space on a nanosatellite. It will launch via a deal with ""Exo-launch"", on a SpaceX Rideshare mission (a low cost launching service that allows shared cost for multiple satellites/customers).

KULR is a CUSTOMER of SpaceX. It seems Mr. Mo has a habit of confusing, ""being a customer of"", and ""being partners with"", a company. Am I a partner of Wendy's when I buy chicken tendies? no.

Mr. Mo does it again with Molicel, which is also listed as a ""customer or partner"", when all they do is supply KULR with battery cells.

**So does KULR have any actual customers??**

Well, yes. A few that are hard to identify. One of them is Viridi Parente. Viridi signed a multi-million, three year contract in 2021 with KULR for their battery thermal safety tech in the development of a stationary energy storage system. Even though KULR communicate a lot to their investors, it's unclear if this partnership with Viridi will be ongoing and grow in the future.

Remember when I mentioned fan AI tech? KULR have been wanting in on the AI and NVIDIA hypetrain this year, so they've been developing an AI using NVIDIA's jetson, to help reduce fan vibrations, and capitalize on the growing amount of AI data centers that use fans. What does it have to do with battery thermal safety tech? Absolutely nothing, but it sure helps drive the stock price up, especially after announcing their sole licensing deal with a mysterious Japanese customer for $1 Million.

Sure makes you wonder, if KULR had a patented top of the line space-ready battery safety technology that could be mass-produced, why would they dedicate resources to developing a completely different technology, when they have a grand total of 57 employees and 2 open positions.

**Then how does KULR make money and stay afloat?**

That's where Mr. Mo hopes you and I come in! Since KULR has never been profitable, and will remain that way for the foreseeable future as they are no where near any sort of mass commercialization for any product, KULR relies on ATM offerings to generate cash, diluting shareholders in the process. The higher the stock price, the more cash they can get from the offerings.

Did I mention Mr. Mo suddenly had this great idea for KULR to become a BTC treasury? What an amazing excuse to dilute shareholders even more while the stock is massively overvalued, despite them not needing any more cash!

[KULR outstanding shares](https://preview.redd.it/gbg8hcq89mae1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=44d669ecd722e4c0850aa3dcf248e008b08b5834)

**Conclusion, TLDR:**

KULR is massively overvalued, whilst having no plan or guidance for any sort of significant revenue increase that would justify a $1 Billion valuation. Instead of focusing on one product/technology, KULR diversifies itself to try and grab as much market attention to drive its stock price up and dilute shareholders. KULR CEO makes up fake ""partnerships"" with big name companies, deceiving investors.

I'm short $3000 since today at 3.67. Not financial advice.

I will tattoo KULR on my forehead and post it here if my position isn't in the green by the end of the year.

1. Dramatic Performance Improvements

The B300 series delivers a 50% increase in compute performance over the B200 series. This performance increase is not only achieved through more compute cores and higher clock frequencies, but also through a more optimized 4NP process (Nvidia's custom 4nm process). For applications that need to process complex AI models, the B300 delivers more efficient computing power, especially in the areas of machine learning, deep learning and high-performance computing.



2. Extra memory and bandwidth

The B300 is equipped with a 12-Hi HBM3E memory stack providing 288GB of memory and 8TB/s of bandwidth. The increased memory capacity enables it to handle larger datasets, making it particularly suitable for training large language models (LLMs) and handling long sequence inference tasks. Higher memory bandwidth accelerates data access and processing, reduces latency, and improves model inference and training efficiency.



3. Lower inference cost

Since the B300 supports processing larger batches and extended sequence lengths, it significantly reduces latency in the inference process and lowers inference costs. For example, the ability to triple inference efficiency allows the full computational power of each GPU to be utilized, thus reducing the cost required to generate the number of tokens per second.



4. Innovative interconnect technology

The B300 utilizes the 800G ConnectX-8 NIC, which provides twice the bandwidth of its predecessor for large-scale clusters and supports more PCIe lanes (48 instead of 32). This enables more efficient data sharing across multiple GPUs, significantly improving overall cluster throughput and computing efficiency, making it ideal for large-scale distributed and cloud computing applications.



5. More flexible supply chain and customization

Nvidia has changed its traditional sales model by no longer supplying complete server hardware, but instead offering core components such as SXM Puck modules and Grace CPUs to OEMs and ODMs, allowing customers to customize them according to their needs. This change brings higher flexibility and scalability to better adapt to the needs of different enterprises, especially for hyperscale data centers and cloud computing vendors, where customization can improve overall performance and efficiency.



6. Higher Scalability

For hyperscale organizations, the B300's NVLink 72 (NVL72) architecture enables 72 GPUs to collaborate on the same problem with low latency. Compared to traditional 8 GPU configurations, the B300 significantly improves batch size scalability, reduces costs and increases the intelligence of the inference chain. This makes the B300 computationally and economically efficient for large-scale inference tasks.



7. Efficient Cooling and Energy Management

Although the power consumption of the B300 series has increased (TDP of 1,400W), the B300 is able to dynamically allocate and adjust power between the CPU and GPU to maximize overall energy efficiency, thanks to a more efficient dynamic power allocation mechanism. Additionally, its design allows for a more efficient water cooling system, which helps reduce operating costs and improve system stability.



Value Proposition

Improved Computing Efficiency: The B300 Series is capable of handling larger datasets and more complex AI models, making it suitable for organizations that require high-performance computing, such as those in the areas of deep learning, inference services, large-scale AI model training, and other applications.

Reduced inference costs: With higher memory capacity and bandwidth, the B300 significantly reduces the cost per inference and improves economics, which is a huge value-add for cloud providers or organizations offering AI services.

Flexible customization: Nvidia's new supply chain model enables organizations to choose the most appropriate hardware configuration for their needs, reducing overall procurement costs and increasing flexibility.

Underpinning Hyperscale Computing: The B300 is a significant technology upgrade for data centers, cloud giants, and other hyperscale computing platforms (e.g., Amazon, Google, Meta), helping them scale compute capacity more efficiently and improve performance.



In summary, the B300 series not only brings significant improvements in multiple aspects such as performance, memory, bandwidth, and energy management, but also provides greater adaptability and scalability through a flexible supply chain and customized design, helping enterprises achieve higher efficiency and lower operating costs in large-scale computing and AI applications.",2024-12-27 15:18:54,0,33,wallstreetbets

Marco Iachini, senior vice president of research at Vanda, said, “NVIDIA's stock price has risen so spectacularly that it has stolen the limelight from Tesla.”



　　



NVIDIA has been favored by investors large and small over the past year or so. Last month, NVIDIA officially joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average and was the top performer among the index's 30 components. Despite slightly volatile trading in December, NVIDIA is still on track to realize a gain of more than 180% by the end of 2024. Today, its market capitalization has surpassed $3 trillion, making it the second-largest U.S. company by market capitalization, behind Apple.



　　



NVIDIA's retail investor position has also increased significantly. According to Vanda's data, NVIDIA's weighting in retail portfolios has risen from 5.5% earlier this year to more than 10%. Currently, NVIDIA is the second-largest position for retail investors, behind Tesla. This year, net inflows of retail money into NVIDIA are up more than 885% from three years ago.

Nvidia will moon - In Depth Benchmarking tests of AMD MX300 vs Nvidia H100 and H200 by SemiAnalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hkb3x4/nvidia_will_moon_in_depth_benchmarking_tests_of/,"tl:dr - the world is as expected. AMD's software needs lots of hand holding and support, Nvidia's runs very well right out of the box. Nvidia maintains performance advantage in nearly every test run. [https://semianalysis.com/2024/12/22/mi300x-vs-h100-vs-h200-benchmark-part-1-training/](https://semianalysis.com/2024/12/22/mi300x-vs-h100-vs-h200-benchmark-part-1-training/)

  
Key Findings

\- Comparing on paper FLOP/s and HBM Bandwidth/Capacity is akin to comparing cameras by merely examining megapixel count. The only way to tell the actual performance is to run benchmarking.

\- Nvidia’s Out of the Box Performance & Experience is amazing, and we did not run into any Nvidia specific bugs during our benchmarks. Nvidia tasked a single engineer to us for technical support, but we didn’t run into any Nvidia software bugs as such we didn’t need much support.

\- AMD’s Out of the Box Experience is very difficult to work with and can require considerable patience and elbow grease to move towards a usable state. On most of our benchmarks, Public AMD stable releases of AMD PyTorch is still broken and we needed workarounds.

\- If we weren’t supported by multiple teams of AMD engineers triaging and fixing bugs in AMD software that we ran into, AMD’s results would have been much lower than Nvidia’s.

\- We ran unofficial MLPerf Training GPT-3 175B on 256 H100 in collaboration with Sustainable Metal Cloud to test the effects of different VBoost setting

\- For AMD, Real World Performance on public stable released software is nowhere close to its on paper marketed TFLOP/s. Nvidia’s real world performance also undershoots its marketing TFLOP/s, but not by nearly as much.

\- The MI300X has a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to the H100/H200, but training performance per TCO is higher on the MI300X on public stable releases of AMD software. This changes if one uses custom development builds of AMD software.

\- Training performance is weaker, as demonstrated by the MI300X ‘s matrix multiplication micro-benchmarks, and AMD public release software on single-node training throughput still lags that of Nvidia’s H100 and H200.

\- MI300X performance is held back by AMD software. AMD MI300X software on BF16 development branches have better performance but has not yet merged into the main branch of AMD’s internal repos. By the time it gets merged into the main branch and into the PyTorch stable release, Nvidia Blackwell will have already been available to everyone.

\- AMD’s training performance is also held back as the MI300X does not deliver strong scale out performance. This is due to its weaker ROCm Compute Communication Library (RCCL) and AMD’s lower degree of vertical integration with networking and switching hardware compared to Nvidia’s strong integration of its Nvidia Collective Communications Library (NCCL), InfiniBand/Spectrum-X network fabric and switches.

\- Many of AMD AI Libraries are forks of NVIDIA AI Libraries, leading to suboptimal outcomes and compatibility issues.

\- AMD customers tend to use hand crafted kernels only for inference, which means their performance outside of very narrow well defined use cases is poor, and their flexibility to rapidly shifting workloads is non-existent.",2024-12-22 23:52:51,173,91,wallstreetbets

"$SERV DD, long term play - Nvidia tendies?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hibt9k/serv_dd_long_term_play_nvidia_tendies/,"Sharing some of my own recent DD, found SERV only 5 days ago and have gone down the rabbit hole.  Conservatively estimating 200-1000% in the next 2 years, much greater if next year is successful.  Institutions are going to like this stock.

Market cap 560M 

Consistent uptrend after major buying in late July after Nvidia investment announced.  People like Jensen Huang tendies.



Summary - Leading autonomous / AI robotics company with a proven team having gotten through an alpha test with their early round of deliveries and is now expanding in 2026 with 2000 more units to scale.  Lower cost than using a car and reduces strain on streets and parking.  Exploring other robotics areas to build products in (think Starbucks, McDonald’s, etc) Major brand names investing and partnering with SERV.


Investors, Integration and News - Invested in by Nvidia (likely getting internal tech support)

Already integrated with Uber and 7-11


Recent events - 

October - Partnered with wing.com (alphabet / google venture).  Serv will drop packages to wing for pickup and delivery’s. The ground game of autonomous delivery chain.

November - acquired Vebu full stack restaurant automation allowing them to build offerings outside of delivery (Starbucks, McDonald’s)

Future - 2026 plan to deploy 2000 more units in progress.



Revenue or Total Addressable Market - massive, if you see the vision and they’re able to execute next year you’re buying a leader massive market potential.  Ali has stated these numbers I believe at 20 million deliveries a day, half of which are walking distance so 10 million a day in the US alone.  20-50 Million $ a day in delivery fees up for grabs in the US alone.  These fees will likely be lower than a driver (at first) prompting people to use the service.

They hope to turn 60-80 million next year from 2000 robots but if they get nowhere near that, the potential is there with other gains they will make advancing the product and getting out the kinks.  Once critical mass is reached and consumers accept these in an area you could imagine them running 24/7 moving things.  We are in the future.


Leader - with Nvidia, a working product that is expanding and weak competitors (e.g competitors drive their robots while serv will operate automously) expect Serv is well positioned to come out as a leader in the US autonomous delivery and restaurant automation.  


Design - care for aesthetics and design with the eyes / wall-e / shopping cart design, needed to make people feel comfortable with the future.


Institutions - started onboarding immediately and expect this to pick up heavily, and into next year with support of Nvidia and partnership with wing.  heavy buying volume from late July.   After cool off has been in constant uptrend from September and edging higher.


Costs - Robot build prices will come down with economies of scale.


Other Benefits - Research and Development in this robotics area poises them for additional spinoffs or pivots into new businesses or government contracts.",2024-12-20 04:26:32,28,11,wallstreetbets
"Nvidia Will Be the next Intel, Why I'm bearish long term. TSMC is the true winner(assuming China doesn't invade)",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hibs0s/nvidia_will_be_the_next_intel_why_im_bearish_long/,"Right now, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta are all spending more than Nvidia on R&D and are developing their own AI chips. Tesla, and AMD are also developing AI chips. Right now, tech companies are only buying Nvidia's chips to get started and build market share, because they do not want to fall behind their competition. 

Using Nvidia's chips at current prices is not profitable, even successful AI companies such as OpenAI fail to achieve positive operating margins despite a highly popular product with paid features. Large tech companies are reluctantly buying Nvidia's hardware to avoid falling behind their competition in market share. But relying on Nvidia long term is never the intention, these companies need to be profitable eventually, Nvidia is just there to get them started.

The thing is, Nvidia's 74.56% gross margin is a strength, but its also a vulnerability. It demonstrates that any AI company that can cut out Nvidia can significantly reduce their costs, and that's why everyone is building their own chips. They don't need to be faster than Nvidia to succeed, they just need to be fast enough to provide services at a lower cost, which is quite a low bar. Developing new products takes time, which is why Nvidia's windfall has lasted. But give it 1-3 more years and you'll start to see the impact on Nvidia's sales.

With everyone rushing to develop their own chips, and all of them relying on TSMC, TSMC has the true windfall. They will certainly be able to hike their prices on wafers due to increased demand, which will hurt Nvidia's margins.

Intel was once a dominant and unstoppable player in the semiconductor space, but then they got too comfortable and started spending their cash flow on dividends and stock buybacks instead of reinvesting in R&D. We see how that played out, with AMD catching up and stealing market share, and now Intel is struggling. No moat is impenetrable.

Nvidia is following in Intel's footsteps with their $50 Billion stock buyback plan at 50x earnings. Despite facing competition from the largest tech companies with deep pockets, they are spending their record windfall just to buy back less than 2% of their shares outstanding. This will be their downfall. They are not hedging their reliance on TSMC by seeking to acquire or develop their own fab business, they are not increasing R&D sufficiently to stay ahead of their competition. This will be their downfall.

In 5-10 years, Nvidia will almost certainly have thinner margins and less market share in the AI space as their customers develop their own in-house solutions. At best, Nvidia will be relied upon for niche applications where performance is essential.",2024-12-20 04:24:32,0,48,wallstreetbets

Broadcom’s Nvidia moment ,https://i.redd.it/iq4wo1x0if7e1.png,"The rally in shares of chipmaker Broadcom after last week’s earnings is reminiscent of when Nvidia’s stock started to take off in 2023. Broadcom now needs to prove it can follow through to become another giant of the AI era.

Broadcom shares have soared 38% since it reported, pushing its market value to almost $1.2 trillion. At the heart of the rally is Broadcom’s prediction that the market for AI components it designs for data centers will be as big as $90 billion in three years. But there’s a lot to be done to turn that into reality.

""This is kind of like the Nvidia moment of maybe a year and a half ago where they blew the number out and everybody had to catch up and chase it,” per Ken Mahoney of Mahoney Asset Management. Broadcom is showing investors that AI computing is so big that there’s plenty of room for other winners aside from Nvidia.

Broadcom stock is up 124% this year, set for its biggest annual gain ever. The stock is now priced at 38 times estimated earnings, suggesting the company has limited room for error. Nvidia, though, has set a bullish precedent for investors wanting to jump onto the next big potential AI winner. Its profits grew so fast last year that the valuation actually got cheaper as the stock rose, because estimates were being raised at an even faster clip.",2024-12-17 15:38:12,82,24,wallstreetbets
NVDA vs AVGO,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hg7zpe/nvda_vs_avgo/,"NVDIA vs Broadcom
I have a pretty big position in NVDA but am obviously not too thrilled with the stock performance since June.

While I am still bullish on NVIDIA and AI, there are a few things that make me pause

Apple doing its whole Apple Intelligence thing not planning to spend a single dollar with NVIDIA but rather building custom chips with Broadcom
Anthropic going all-in with Amazon's Trainium chips. In the past, big funding for AI startups meant a big check for Jensen. This didn't happen here and could set a precedent
Broadcom announcing that it will build 1 million XPU (ASIC) data centers with hyperscalers.
So while NVIDIA is clearly ahead of AMD, I don't like the shift to Broadcom ASIC chips. And to be honest it makes a lot of sense to me that Meta or Amazon would build their own chips to do stuff like recommendation engines.

So my question is: would you diversify/sell some NVDA stock to buy AVGO in order to be able to benefit both from the GPU and ASIC trends?",2024-12-17 10:42:53,12,37,wallstreetbets

NVIDIA: A Victim of Its Own Success,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hdkgah/nvidia_a_victim_of_its_own_success/,"People wondering today why AVGO spiked but isn’t helping NVDA. In fact, there are now (idiotic) rumors that AVGO’s business booming is bad for NVDA.
Just so you guys are aware, Broadcom competes with Mavel in specialized custom GPU chips (which cost, say $400-500 million a chip). NVDA competes with AMD (although AMD is like miles behind) in non-specialized GPU chips which come with software (CUDA), development assistance etc for companies. 

NVDA and Broadcom DO NOT directly compete. Broadcom is NOT a threat to NVDA’s business. However, NVDA can be a huge threat to Broadcom. If NVDA tells big tech they will produce custom chips for them, Broadcom’s business will take a MASSIVE hit. Broadcom cannot compete with NVDA or even AMD in the non-specialized GPU chips section because there’s a software lock in, logistics base etc that NVDA has already developed.

Now, why is NVDA stock getting destroyed? Because it became too popular, and now trades so purely on swings in the market due to lots of retail traders etc, that good news barely moves it etc. There’s very little correlation. Expectations to NVDA now are so sky high—the expectation is that NVDA will always beat, so it’s hard for the stock to blow away expectations anymore. Compare that with Broadcom, which isn’t the most popular AI name (i.e. NVDA). That keeps overall sentiment much more tame for AVGO allowing it to blow out even though the quarter was mixed.

If news came out tomorrow that Blackwell is selling like hot cakes, stock still wouldn’t move on it. NVDA’s stock has become a victim of its own success—of its popularity. When I invested in the stock in 2018, it acted much more rationally than the stock price does nowadays.

Google Cloud Against the Odds: Beating Microsoft and OpenAI in the AI race to the top!,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hcmqwe/google_cloud_against_the_odds_beating_microsoft/,"https://preview.redd.it/2gel2qczkf6e1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=176be681bd0ad144f855a86fc9da71e70264906a

In a recent Wall Street survey, Google Cloud topped Microsoft (MSFT.O) and OpenAI as the “most strategic” AI vendor.



Budget changes. As the holiday season approaches, technology procurement leaders at major enterprises are busy prioritizing their technology spending plans for 2025. These budget adjustments could signal potential changes in market share and spending direction.



While OpenAI and Microsoft are getting a lot of attention in the AI space, a new CIO (chief information officer) survey shows that Alphabet (GOOGL.O) is rapidly coming into its own in the enterprise AI spending race.



Piper Sandler's 2025 CIO Survey, which was released over the weekend, interviewed 81 CIOs about their budget priorities for different vendors and technology areas.



“The tech industry will be dynamic in 2025,” Piper Sandler's analyst team writes, ”with generative AI transitioning from the testing/planning phase to implementation and driving growth in cloud spending.”



Analysts noted that 87 percent of CIOs expect their IT budgets to increase in 2025, the highest percentage since the survey began in 2020.



The popularity of Google Cloud increased significantly compared to the previous two surveys. In the “most strategic” AI vendor category, Google Cloud received 27 percent support, up from 15 percent six months ago. Meanwhile, Microsoft, the former leader, saw its support drop from 33% to 24%.



Google Cloud also topped the ranking of AI infrastructure providers. When asked which cloud company they plan to test or implement AI projects with next year, 50 percent of respondents chose Google Cloud.



Overall, this is good news for the major cloud infrastructure providers.The uptick in interest in AI applications and projects has led to higher spending intentions than six months ago for all providers, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).



The trend has been equally favorable to the parent companies of these cloud companies - Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet and Oracle (ORCL.N).



It's also a big plus for NVIDIA (NVDA.O), according to Harsh Kumar, a semiconductor analyst at Piper.



All cloud companies are big customers of NVIDIA's AI chips. NVIDIA holds more than 70 percent of the AI GPU (graphics processing unit) market, according to analysts.Kumar expects the AI chip market to exceed $500 billion by 2028.



If CIOs' budget plans come to fruition, 2025 will be a major growth year for AI. Investors are already picking up on the trend, with Alphabet's shares having risen nearly 15 percent this month.

Personally, I think the short-term risk is high and the better strategy in the long run is to buy low

Englander just 10X'd his fund's stake in Walgreens ,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hbqc3p/englander_just_10xd_his_funds_stake_in_walgreens/,"Englander just 10X'd his fund's stake in this nearly 12%-yielding healthcare stock

But while Israel Englander has been sending shares of the hottest AI stock on the planet to the chopping block, he's been busy purchasing shares of pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), which is trading at levels last observed in the late 20th century and yielding more than 11.5%!

During the September-ended quarter, Englander's fund bought 5,138,342 shares of Walgreens, which increased its position by a whopping 953% in just three months! It should be noted that Millennium commonly hedges its common-stock holdings with put and call options, which is the case with both Nvidia and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

To say that things have been challenging for Walgreens would be nothing short of an understatement. It's facing growing online pharmacy pressure from the likes of Amazon, has endured complications (i.e., sizable writedowns) in its efforts to become a healthcare-services company, and has even had its operating results negatively impacted in select markets by theft.

Despite these challenges, which have slashed Walgreens Boots Alliance's share price by more than 90% since it hit an all-time high, Englander and his team have piled in.

One of the primary catalysts for Walgreens was the appointment of Tim Wentworth as CEO in October 2023. Whereas prior CEO Rosalind Brewer was a seasoned retail leader but lacked healthcare experience, Wentworth brings decades of healthcare leadership to the table. While his rip-off-the-Band-Aid approach has been a bit of a shock to Wall Street and investors, he's not been shy about laying out his long-term vision for Walgreens.

For the moment, the company is focused on bringing down costs, as well as promoting higher-margin initiatives. The plan is to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. stores over the next three fiscal years, which will lower its operating expenses and focus the company's efforts on areas of higher opportunity.

Furthermore, Wentworth intends to keep promoting its healthcare-services transition. Even though its partnership with and investment in VillageMD has led to sizable writedowns, Walgreens' chief believes the company is moving toward recurring profitability from its co-located primary care clinics.

As of this writing, Walgreens Boots Alliance is yielding an almost unfathomable 11.5%. However, with Walgreens in cost-cutting mode and the company attempting a multiyear turnaround, it wouldn't be surprising if this payout was cut again or shelved entirely to preserve cash.

While I do believe Walgreens Boots Alliance has the tools to effect a turnaround, it's going to be a slow process filled with plenty of potholes and speed bumps.

NVIDIA Positioned for Growth Amid AI Boom Fueled by TSMC's Strong Revenue,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hb3ywu/nvidia_positioned_for_growth_amid_ai_boom_fueled/,"NVIDIA Positioned for Growth Amid AI Boom Fueled by TSMC's Strong Revenue

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) reported a remarkable 34% increase in November revenue, reaching NT$276 billion ($8.48 billion) compared to NT$206 billion in November 2023. This surge underscores the continued strength of the semiconductor market, driven largely by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. As TSMC plays a pivotal role in manufacturing advanced semiconductors, including those designed by NVIDIA, this is a positive signal for NVIDIA’s growth trajectory.

A Strategic Partnership in AI

TSMC’s position as the primary manufacturer of NVIDIA’s advanced GPUs places NVIDIA at the heart of the AI boom. The robust demand for AI-driven applications, ranging from data centers to autonomous vehicles, highlights the increasing reliance on NVIDIA’s cutting-edge technology. TSMC’s strong revenue performance reinforces the sustained demand for NVIDIA-designed chips, which are integral to powering the AI revolution.

AI Momentum Driving Growth

The rising sales at TSMC indicate that NVIDIA’s AI-focused products continue to be in high demand despite macroeconomic challenges such as geopolitical tensions and trade uncertainties. NVIDIA’s GPUs are critical for AI workloads, and the continued momentum in semiconductor sales reflects the growing adoption of AI technologies across industries.

NVIDIA’s reliance on TSMC for chip production aligns with the latter’s robust manufacturing capabilities, ensuring that NVIDIA remains well-positioned to meet global AI demands. This strategic partnership enables NVIDIA to leverage TSMC’s technological advancements, further solidifying its leadership in the AI space.

Industry Outlook and Strategic Advantage

While TSMC’s sales dipped 12.2% from October, the company’s year-over-year growth and the upward trend in AI adoption suggest a long-term positive outlook for NVIDIA. As analysts project NT$849 billion in TSMC revenue for the December quarter, meeting this target would further validate the strength of NVIDIA’s demand pipeline.

The AI sector’s explosive growth has been a key driver for NVIDIA, whose stock has already experienced significant gains in 2024. With TSMC’s revenue figures reinforcing the broader AI market momentum, NVIDIA remains a critical player poised to capitalize on this trend.

Conclusion: A Bright Future

TSMC’s strong performance is a bellwether for NVIDIA’s continued success in the AI market. As AI applications expand across industries, NVIDIA’s leadership in GPU innovation and its strategic relationship with TSMC position the company for sustained growth. Investors can view TSMC’s robust sales as a reinforcing factor for NVIDIA’s bright outlook in an increasingly AI-driven world.",2024-12-10 15:13:49,3,16,wallstreetbets
"Here's why I'm shorting Soundhound, a current WSB darling",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hagtg0/heres_why_im_shorting_soundhound_a_current_wsb/,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. [Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares](https://imgur.com/a/5qWs8Sp)

**Tl;dr:**

* At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever.
* Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record.
* Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue
* Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle

# Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining

Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that **all** of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, **Soundhound’s business declined \~9%.**

Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired ***is also declining***). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get \~$44.7M. 

[Amelia Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/o6mvsq4dav5e1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=53f34074638912ededf539313815c93fb003f2b7)

We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but **Amelia is actually not a SaaS business**, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be \~$22M (50% \* $44.7M). 

Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize \~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, **$13M (58% \* $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.** 

Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that **the organic Soundhound business generated just \~$12M, declining \~9% year-over-year.**

[Soundhound Q3 Growth](https://preview.redd.it/yu7yewcf5v5e1.png?width=287&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a4772913c6de5115fd73ae89163d65190b96187)

Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, **revenue for** **both** **Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!** 

Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue **will decline by a staggering 27% YoY**. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting.

[Soundhound Q4 guidance](https://preview.redd.it/tdflfz1j5v5e1.png?width=296&format=png&auto=webp&s=c27f8baa8ce37100bf9ab74aad5af901f0ffef70)

When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - **95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.** 

[Soundhound revenue by type](https://preview.redd.it/ruxcyb0s5v5e1.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f2a5ffd325ab2615d2c0831f31a879b92cebb19)

This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company. 

# Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue

Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack. 

Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their [website](https://www.americanheritagecu.org/), click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went: 

[Amelia Chat](https://preview.redd.it/r5ujc4en6v5e1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb43d5aff2e3d3fb7da62ce343c93c9c2574cd12)

Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. **This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.** 

Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai [website ](https://olukai.com/pages/contact)and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went: 

[Sierra chat](https://preview.redd.it/b7txd7lq6v5e1.png?width=559&format=png&auto=webp&s=088bfe0c601b8be9afd42b1acb3d6c2ecd3430e6)

The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others. 

None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years. 

But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, **why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations?** That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you. 

None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also \~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger:

https://preview.redd.it/icz23hx07v5e1.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=95b6f256e0975d1efcbd30088077176ed268f551

In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of \~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. **Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!** 

Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because **they don’t sell very much software**, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings: 

[Amelia revenue by type](https://preview.redd.it/hfmpse697v5e1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=8347bb1b070988f4e2b28a5fc51760fa07978b9c)

The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. **The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report,** so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”. 

Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%. 

# Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk

Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers. 

Adding to the problem is customer concentration: **62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers**, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater.

https://preview.redd.it/lwhmohjk7v5e1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=684e25adcd9bcb7a1aa1d565549e32196a4c429e

Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, **Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers.**

https://preview.redd.it/zgvxxjan7v5e1.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f3483c49c95c31b3f348a3f0a1f8f49bd1f87d5

# The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO

If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance.

Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a [private $75M venture round](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/soundhound-raises-75m-to-bring-its-voice-enabled-ai-everywhere/), long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s [2021 de-SPAC process](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840856/000121390021059758/ea150505ex99-2_archimedes.htm), yet retail investors and media only took notice when [Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000021/xslForm13F_X02/information_table.xml) report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day.

https://preview.redd.it/3o6rpulq7v5e1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=224e650fcb4281072d203301362e0f74fdb2a786

Prior to this, the **one and only time** NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them:

https://preview.redd.it/0y6gvezt7v5e1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=379365fe89c9d7410816d3ea0dc662c10d27180e

Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a [press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240318067099/en/) about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, **Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times**, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, **Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023** based on a trip to the Wayback machine

[NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023](https://preview.redd.it/4toe71qx7v5e1.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=a596eeddf44e08e19aaf7dd7c321a3d886ad4ea1)

But let’s examine the facts. [Nvidia’s DRIVE platform](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/partners/) is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, **including Soundhound’s closest competitor** (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a [blog post](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/cerence-generative-ai-in-car-experience/) showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. **If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly?**

[NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current \(Cerence\)](https://preview.redd.it/c0iczsy28v5e1.png?width=1415&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a889071b541ebc556505e51c7e2a5b0ec9e2ec)

The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. **Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story.**

This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype.

# Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher)

In its [press release](https://www.soundhound.com/newsroom/press-releases/soundhound-ai-acquires-amelia-significantly-expanding-its-scale-and-reach-in-conversational-ai-across-new-verticals-and-hundreds-of-enterprise-brands/) announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…”

While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal. 

https://preview.redd.it/zv6qjd798v5e1.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1b556d4a600df16dfc48a0a38d59c79ce40bf64

The details can be found in the [stock purchase agreement](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/121390024066351/2?cik=1840856), but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices)

This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts.

# Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards

I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound

Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself). 

We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August. 

With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x.

For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer.

My thesis on INTC going into 2025,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h8n76e/my_thesis_on_intc_going_into_2025/,"I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025. Disclaimer: I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of $29.30

I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed.

Most of the ""AI revolution"" has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead. Intel is competing with TSMC, and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 7.9B (which was even reduced) from the US government. On top of that, the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies, 6.6B, to TSMC to build in the US. So really, the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC. The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan, which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do, instead of subsidies. This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing; while TSMC can manufacture in the US, CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US, in either Malaysia or Taiwan, and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs.

In the chip design space, Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia, and now Apple, Amazon, OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture. Intel still dominates the CPU space, but your average datacenter rack might have 10/20+ GPUs for each CPU. AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs, and as such takes about 25% of the market. Intel's only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market, which mainly targets budget gaming, crypto mining, and cheap datacenter. The newest release of the ""Battlemage"" B580 is expected to compete with Nvidia's 4060 at the under $300 MSRP market, which are lofty goals. Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones. So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US, while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now.

It's clear that on the design front, Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful. While this is their core business and majority of revenue, it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others. Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party. Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering.

However, the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain. It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90% of the world's sub 5nm chips was a bad idea. That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act; Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this. The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired; Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement, which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act.

TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government. This is so that the country keeps its ""Silicon Shield"", the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China. But Intel has no such limitation. And TSMC is not able to fufill 100% of the orders for its customers; it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI. This demand exists for Intel to take part of.

So, Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry, not Products, side of the business. This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict: It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division, most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design. This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest, which I suspect is keeping them from customers. The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products, so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry, which is what the US wants.

I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon. It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen. If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC, and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs, it could become the US TSMC. Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm, which is the current cutting edge. But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration, and so they will work towards this goal. To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel. That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025.

If you got this far, thank you for reading.

EDIT: Now that I think about it, it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intel's Products division. I think they expressed as much earlier this year, but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit.",2024-12-07 07:17:11,157,167,wallstreetbets

NVIDIA's share price surge and the outlook for the AI arithmetic market: bubble risk and rational layout of industry giants ’,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h6ph5g/nvidias_share_price_surge_and_the_outlook_for_the/,"https://preview.redd.it/8ei98fya0w4e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbc0a93b262593e8ea76c7e7efbfacacac3502b5

As NVIDIA's share price has risen sharply in the short term, many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants, GPUs, as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips, are currently far from meeting demand. We can assume that AI applications are still only in their infancy, and there has not yet been a particularly prominent Al burst application in the world.

Analyse the results:

The AI market is still at an early stage: AI applications, despite explosive growth in recent years, are still at an early stage. The arithmetic power required for current AI applications (e.g., big language modelling, autonomous driving, robotics, etc.), especially GPUs, is still in the pre-burst stage. The growth of Tesla and the robotics industry, for example, predicts that billions of robots will be needed in the future for arithmetic support. This means that there is a huge potential for growth in AI arithmetic demand over the next few years, especially in inferential computing.



GPUs as core hardware for AI: GPUs play a key role in AI inference computing, especially in tasks that require high parallel processing power (e.g., deep learning inference, autonomous driving, robot control, etc.). Although there are already many GPU products on the market, overall, the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply, and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand, especially in the ‘reasoning’ segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation, especially in the field of automated driving, cloud computing and so on.



Personal view: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU space is well recognised, but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short-term surge in its share price.

NVIDIA's dominant position: Currently, NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware (especially GPUs), and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations, especially playing a central role in large-scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA's rising share price reflects investors' optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market.



Bubble Risk: As NVIDIA's share price has surged, the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA's high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble, especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising, the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors (e.g. AMD) could change the market landscape. Therefore, investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short-term speculation.



Core view: US tech giants (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) are supportive of NVIDIA's technology, but they will also support NVIDIA's competitors, such as AMD, in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry.



Analyse the results:

Rational rather than short-term profit-driven: the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short-term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic, but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD, these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone, ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision-making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market.



If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure, it could lead to overpricing, affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD.



In summary: future outlook and risks

Huge potential for AI arithmetic: The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling, especially in the area of inferential computing, and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades, especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving.



NVIDIA's dominance and risks: While NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored, the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition, especially the rise of competitors such as AMD, may affect NVIDIA's market share.



Long-term layout of industry giants: U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic, they will not simply pursue short-term benefits, but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology, to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years.

The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential, but is still in the early stages of development. While NVIDIA occupies a leading position in the AI hardware market, its high valuation and share price volatility also make the risk of a bubble

Net income doubled to $20 billion and the company showed a strong outlook for future quarters, slightly exceeding market expectations. However, while growth remains impressive, fourth-quarter expected revenue of $37.5 billion is growing at a slower pace, well below the strong growth seen in previous quarters (122%, 262%, 265%). Since then, market concerns about a possible trade war in China have intensified, causing shares to fall

Despite the slowing growth concerns, analysts believe NVIDIA's fundamentals remain solid. The company's dominant position in artificial intelligence and its production capacity constraints mean that it still has plenty of room to grow its revenues. The stock is expected to reach $170 in the next three months. However, while NVIDIA still has investment potential, a number of other AI stocks could offer higher returns in the shorter term and are worth keeping an eye on. If you're looking for an AI stock that's more promising than NVDA but trades for less than 5x its earnings we can talk to each other

Where are future returns even supposed to come from? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h1w2h9/where_are_future_returns_even_supposed_to_come/,"Happy thanksgiving to all of you, I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. 

This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed, and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment, so let's discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. 

First, there's the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. 

But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. 

Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%!

I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5%. What is supposed to happen here? Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10% yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never, even in my fever dreams, would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. 

It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right. But multiples are arguably way ahead of themselves. Current CAPE-ratio has only been higher during two times in history: 1929 and the dotcom bubble. This is kind of a cliché but at the same time, owning these stocks nets you nearly nothing. So what's the game here? Are people betting that Costco will trade at 80x earnings next year? 

Everything I know as a value investor tells me that this must end and that it is time to hedge. But at the same time, anyone who has shorted this ridiculous market has been ground to a pulp by the onslaught of endless liquidity that's pouring into the market. 

So what do you guys think? Are the U.S. stock markets about to pull a Nikkei and leave us all grinding our teeth until 2040 before a new high will be set? Hope that turkey tastes well by the way. ",2024-11-28 13:34:58,398,285,wallstreetbets
I have reasons to believe that Recursion (RXRX) will became quite popular in the next month.,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h1volv/i_have_reasons_to_believe_that_recursion_rxrx/,"I believe that in the future, drugs will be highly customisable based on the patience’s health history. Based on your physiology, syndromes, and genetics, you may receive a drug that is well-suited for you and only you. 

How can you do that? First and foremost, you need data, huge amounts of it. We all know how generative and predictive models had advanced in the last year. It wasn’t in fact, until the launch of AlphaFold (by Google, whose team was recently awarded with the Chemistry Nobel Prize), that AI drug discovery became prominent. This open source model is used for molecular discovery. Again, would be nice if a company could:

1. Generate proprietary synthetic, good quality molecular data using models like AlphaFold.
2. Using this data to train models for drug discovery, reducing pipelines costs and times up to 50%.
3. Eventually, with the possibility of bringing the first AI-aided drug to the market.

First two points have been achieved, and the company is Recursion. We may know them because NVIDIA invested 50m in them. Why then are at ATL? I think the answer is time. We all know there is no room for patience when it comes to money sometimes. Training and bringing such results may take years.

However, I think another catalyst is coming. On 9. December, they will host a seminar for new readouts in one of their most well-known drugs in development, CDK7, for advance solid tumours (an inhibitor, which are currently none approved by the FDA).

Now, I am not saying that they will cure cancer - that’s BS. But over the years converging to novel oncological solutions using AI? This is not the only drug they have (other 9 are in development).

They have more than 60 petabytes of data.
They combined forces with Exscientia recently, forming probably the most important powerhouse of AI-drug research.
They are extremely active in the research field (see their presence in the upcoming NeuRIPS conference) or their new open dataset for Quantum Computing (OpenQDC).

I started investing in IONQ in 2021 for a similar impression. Now I am getting the same vibes with this. I feel that a small catalyst will put this to fly, although the real potencial will come in the next 5-10 years. If they can bring the first AI drug to the market,  this implodes.

Of course, no financial advice. I’m long 800 shares and loading as much as I possibly can.",2024-11-28 13:13:43,383,231,wallstreetbets

NVDA is about to take off (technically speaking): why I feel more confident following my previous post ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h1fhpm,"Greetings,

I hope everyone is getting ready to talk stocks and politics at the Thanksgiving table because that's what the holiday is all about, amiright?

I for one will be talking about NVDA.

I posted earlier today around 10am-11am EST and said that NVDA was gonna stop sliding at 131-ish, since there is a good support there.

And what happened???? The turkey came home to roast

Yes, that's right - it snapped back like a rubber band into your eye. Ok, so that means that the support level that I suggested held for a 3rd time, making it very reliable.

And to add some sugar to that sweet potato pie, the stock closed up $3 from the low and a bullish pattern formed throughout the whole day - the cup and handle (""C+H"").

If you don't know what the C+H pattern looks like, go to your mom's breakfront where she keeps all the tchotchkes and the fine china and take out a tea cup. Hold it up and look at it from the side, with the cup's handle on the right side. Then look at the screenshots I uploaded. It's the same thing.

This mean stock go up.

Interesting how NVDA held at that support level and then the entire day formed a C+H pattern... Hmmm... 

Smells bullish, that's the vibe.


Positions:

Still the 500 shares of NVDA @ $142.25

$Dell Earnings ,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0q4ii/dell_earnings/,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024. 

Thoughts? Should I continue to hold? Or sell during the holiday rally? My portfolio time horizon is short giving I plan to liquidate July 2024 to buy a house. ",2024-11-26 23:28:30,2,28,wallstreetbets
dell earnings are going to be good,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0lm56/dell_earnings_are_going_to_be_good/,"Dell Technologies' upcoming earnings report could be influenced by several factors that may lead to either positive or negative outcomes.

**Potential Positive Factors:**

1. **Strong Demand for AI-Optimized Servers:** Dell has experienced significant growth in its Infrastructure Solutions Group, particularly in AI-optimized servers. In the second quarter, this segment achieved record revenue of $11.65 billion, a 38% increase year-over-year, driven by partnerships with companies like Coreweave and Elon Musk's xAI, which utilize Dell hardware for AI infrastructure. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/dell-beats-second-quarter-revenue-estimates-driven-by-ai-server-demand-2024-08-29/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
2. **Strategic Partnerships and Product Launches:** Dell's collaboration with Nvidia has bolstered its AI capabilities, including the shipment of server racks based on Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 Blackwell system. These advancements position Dell to capitalize on the growing AI market. [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/dell-stock-earnings-501814ec?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
3. **Positive Analyst Outlooks:** Analysts have expressed optimism about Dell's performance. Morgan Stanley reiterated an ""Overweight"" rating with a $154 price target, citing expected momentum building into 2025.

  
The main negative side is that margins could be impacted lower due to increased competition In the ai server space.

  
So overall I woudl say 70% bullish for 15-20% otm calls, and 30% bearish hedge 15% otm",2024-11-26 20:16:23,0,41,wallstreetbets
